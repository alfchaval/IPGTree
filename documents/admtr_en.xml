<point text="Annotated Digital Magic Tournament Rules">
	<point text="Updated: 05-06-2020"></point>
	<point text="Introduction">
		<point text="Tournament Play has always been a big part of Magic: The Gathering. With more and more tournaments being held digitally, it is more important than ever to have a guide to call out what is unique about playing or running a digital tournament."></point>
		<point text="This document will provide a similar infrastructure to the guidelines provided by the Tabletop MTR, but with a focus on digital tournaments and the unique challenges that come with running an event with players spread out all over the world."></point>
		<point text="As much as possible, digital tournaments are to be run consistently regardless of their location. This ensures equal treatment of players in different regions and enables their smooth transition to international tournaments. It is our expectation that players are treated equally and share responsibilities that are called out in this document. Both players and officials should cooperate to achieve their common goal of running a smooth digital tournament. Players and officials must treat each other in a fair and respectful manner, following both the rules and the spirit in which those rules were created. Players are responsible for following the most current version of the Digital Magic Tournament Rules and Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules. Spectators have their own set of responsibilities. Individuals violating these rules are subject to penalties defined by the appropriate document(s)."></point>
		<point text="Information in this document may contradict (or have information not contained in) the Comprehensive Rules. In such cases, this document takes precedence."></point>
		<point text="This document is meant to be the default rule set for digital tournaments. Tournament Organizers may have Official fact sheets for specific tournaments which may define alternative or additional policies or procedures. If a contradiction exists between this document and an official fact sheet, the information in the fact sheet takes precedence."></point>
		<point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to alter these rules, as well as the right to interpret, modify, clarify, or otherwise issue official changes to these rules without prior notice."></point>
		<point text="Updates will be made to this document as necessary. The dates for updates to the legality of individual cards in formats contained in this document will be communicated with at least one week’s notice. Other updates not involving changes to card legality may occur without prior announcement."></point>
		<point text="This document is intended to be a supplement to the Magic Tournament Rules published here:"></point>

	</point>
	<point text="1. Tournament Fundamentals">
        <point text="1.1 Tournament Types">
			<point text="Digital events governed by this document are run using the Magic: The Gathering Arena (MTG Arena) Game Client."></point>
			<point text="There are currently two major Types of digital events: Online and LAN. In Online events, players are generally playing from remote locations using their own device and connection to play. In LAN events, players are generally playing in the same place using the same network connection."></point>
			<point text="Sanctioned tournaments, including both tabletop and digital events, are divided into two types: Premier and non-Premier. Premier tournaments are run by Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament Organizers. They have unique names and features. Non-Premier tournaments include all tournaments that are not explicitly Premier."></point>
			<point text="Some Premier tournaments may consist of both Online and LAN stages within the same tournament."></point>
			<point text="There are two major tournament formats: Limited and Constructed. Each tournament format has rules specific to its format. In Limited tournaments, all product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed tournaments, players compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some Premier tournaments may consist of multiple formats and stages within the same tournament."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.2 Publishing Tournament Information">
			<point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish tournament information at any time (including during the tournament). Tournament information includes, but is not limited to, the contents of one or more players' decks, descriptions of strategies or play, transcripts, and video reproductions. Tournament Organizers are also allowed to publish this information once their tournament is complete."></point>
			<point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish penalty and suspension information."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.3 Tournament Roles">
			<point text="The following roles are defined for tournament purposes:"></point>
			<point text="• Tournament Organizer (or TO)"></point>
			<point text="• Head Judge"></point>
			<point text="• Judge/Tournament Admin"></point>
			<point text="• Lead Admin"></point>
			<point text="• Player"></point>
			<point text="• Spectator"></point>
			<point text="The first four roles above are considered tournament officials. The Head Judge and judges/tournament admins are collectively considered judges. A single individual may act in any combination of tournament official roles. Individuals who are not judges at a tournament are spectators in any match in which they are not playing. Members of the press are also considered spectators."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.4 Participation Eligibility">
			<point text="Anyone is eligible to participate as a player in a DCI-sanctioned digital tournament except for:"></point>
			<point text="• Individuals currently suspended by the DCI. Players suspended by the DCI cannot be registered in tournaments using Wizards-owned tournament software, and organizers are expected to make a good-faith effort in ensuring suspended players do not compete in sanctioned events should a tournament be run on alternative software. Individuals currently suspended from the DCI may not act as tournament officials"></point>
			<point text="• Other individuals specifically prohibited from participation by Wizards of the Coast policy (such determination is at Wizards of the Coast’s sole discretion)"></point>
			<point text="• Individuals under the age of 13 cannot participate in any DCI-sanctioned digital tournament, and additional restrictions may apply to individuals under the age of 18 if the digital tournament awards prize money"></point>
			<point text="• Anyone prohibited by federal, state, or local laws, the rules of the Tournament Organizer, or by a venue’s management"></point>
			<point text="• Tournament Organizers may choose to further restrict eligibility for any events that they organize. They must clearly indicate this in their marketing for the event as well as any other place they display the event information. (i.e. Tournament Organizers may advertise an age 16 and under Friday Night Magic)"></point>
			<point text="Anyone is eligible to participate as a tournament official (Tournament Organizer, Head Judge, judge/tournament admin or Head Admin) for a tournament except for:"></point>
			<point text="• Individuals currently suspended by the DCI"></point>
			<point text="• Anyone who has played in the tournament, unless it is a tournament that explicitly allows tournament officials to play while acting as a tournament official"></point>
			<point text="Tournament officials may play in tournaments in which the official tournament fact sheet specifically permits officials of that tournament to play. This should only happen for more casual events like Prerelease or FNM events."></point>
			<point text="If tournament officials play in the tournament, and they are not permitted to by the fact sheet, the tournament will be invalidated. Tournament officials are required to officiate tournaments fairly and without regard to their own self-interest."></point>
			<point text="The owners of organizations that run Premier Events are not permitted to play in those tournaments, even if the owner is not listed as a tournament official (organizer, judge, and/or lead admin) for that tournament."></point>
			<point text="Some tournaments have additional criteria regarding player and tournament official eligibility (e.g. invitation-only tournaments, such as Players Tour and Players Tour Finals)."></point>
			<point text="The Players Tour Invitation Policy defines specific eligibility rules with regards to certain types of invitation-only Premier Tournaments (e.g. Players Tour and Players Tour Finals)."></point>
			<point text="Individuals with questions regarding their tournament eligibility should contact Wizards of the Coast by emailing esports@wizards.com."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.5 Wizards.com Account">
			<point text="Tournament participants must have a Wizards Account, which is required to play Magic: The Gathering Arena, in order to register. Players without a Wizards.com Account can obtain one by registering for an account through the Magic: The Gathering Arena game client. By signing up for an account, players agree to all:"></point>
			<point text="Terms of Use"></point>
			<link text="https://company.wizards.com/legal/terms"></link>
			<point text="Privacy Policy"></point>

			<link text="https://company.wizards.com/legal/code-conduct"></link>
		</point>
		<point text="1.6 Tournament Organizer">
			<point text="The Tournament Organizer of a tournament is responsible for all tournament logistics including:"></point>
			<point text="• Securing a sanctioning number from Wizards of the Coast"></point>
			<point text="• Choosing a platform for the tournament to run that meets the tournament’s expected needs"></point>
			<point text="• Advertising the tournament in advance of the tournament date"></point>

			<point text="• Providing a hub for communication for Players and Staff necessary to operate the tournament (e.g. a TO owned Discord server)"></point>
			<point text="• Reporting the tournament results to Wizards of the Coast"></point>
			<point text="• Saving tournament data for a period of 6 months (to aid in match appeals)"></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.7 Head Judge">
			<point text="Sanctioned tournaments require the presence of a Head Judge during play to adjudicate disputes, interpret rules, and make other official decisions. The Head Judge is the final judicial authority at any tournament and all tournament participants are expected to follow their interpretations."></point>
			<point text="The Head Judge’s responsibilities include:"></point>
			<point text="• Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a Non-Head Judge/Tournament Admin"></point>
			<point text="• Coordinating and delegating tasks to judges as needed"></point>
			<point text="If necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer their duties to any judge if they are unable to fulfill them for a period of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances, if the tournament’s integrity would be damaged otherwise, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head Judge."></point>
			<point text="Certain Premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or different Head Judges for different portions of the tournament. All Head Judges share the same responsibilities and exercise the same authority while they are serving as a Head Judge."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.8 Judges/Tournament Admins">
			<point text="Judges/Tournament Admins are available to players and spectators to answer questions, help resolve issues, or assist with reasonable requests."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.9 Lead Admin">
			<point text="The Lead Admin ensures the correct generation of pairings and all other tournament records throughout the tournament. The Lead Admin’s responsibilities include:"></point>
			<point text="• Generating correct pairings each round and accurately entering the results of those rounds"></point>
			<point text="• Generating standings and brackets where appropriate"></point>
			<point text="• Solving all scorekeeping problems that arise in consultation with the Head Judge"></point>
			<point text="• Recording and tracking penalties throughout the tournament"></point>
			<point text="The Head Judge has the final authority in determining corrective action for scorekeeping errors."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.10 Players">
			<point text="Players are responsible for:"></point>
			<point text="• Behaving in a respectful manner toward tournament officials, other tournament participants, and spectators and refraining from unsporting conduct at all times"></point>
			<point text="• Complying with announced start times and time limits"></point>
			<point text="• Calling attention to any rules or policy infraction they notice in their matches"></point>
			<point text="• Bringing to a judge’s attention any discrepancies in their tournament match record"></point>
			<point text="• Having a single Wizards Account in good standing that is theirs and not shared by anyone else"></point>
			<point text="• Joining the communication channel required by the Tournament Organizer"></point>
			<point text="• Refraining from enrolling in tournaments in which they are not allowed by policy to participate"></point>
			<point text="• Being familiar with the rules contained within this document"></point>
			<point text="• Being present/online and actively responsive for the tournament"></point>
			<point text="The following is required in order for a Player to participate:"></point>
			<point text="• A stable internet connection"></point>
			<point text="• An up to date Magic: The Gathering Arena Game Client and a device that will properly run the program at the recommended hardware specifications for that device."></point>
			<point text="for hardware specifications see:"></point>
			<link text="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena/faq"></link>
			<point text="Players who choose to participate in a tournament using a device that is below the recommended hardware specifications assume all responsibility for gameplay or connection issues they experience, and neither the tournament organizer nor Wizards of the Coast are responsible for any issues those players experience for any reason."></point>
			<point text="Players may be required to use equipment provided by a Tournament Organizer. If this is the case, the responsibility for equipment provided by the Organizer is now theirs, and no longer the Player’s responsibility. If an Organizer does not explicitly say they are providing equipment or Internet, Players should assume they need to provide their own."></point>
			<point text="Players who do not fulfill their responsibilities may be subject to penalties and review. Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to suspend or revoke a player's account without prior notice for any reason they deem necessary."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="1.11 Spectators">
			<point text="Any person physically present at a tournament, or present in the channel the Tournament Organizer identifies as the place Official Tournament information is posted, and not in any other category above is a spectator. If spectators believe they have observed a rules or policy violation, they are encouraged to alert a judge as soon as possible."></point>
		</point>
	</point>
	<point text="2. Tournament Mechanics">
		<point text="2.1 Match Structure">
			<point text="A Magic match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games (usually two). Drawn games do not count toward this goal. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw."></point>
			<point text="The Tournament Organizer may change the required number of games to be won for any portion of the tournament, as long as this choice is announced before the tournament begins."></point>
			<point text="For all digital tournaments, in the event the tournament is reported to Wizards of the Coast, only match results are reported. However, game results are expected to be tracked by tournament organizers for the purposes of tiebreakers of the event"></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.2 Play/Draw Rule">
			<point text="For the first game of a match, a designated player - chosen at random by MTG ARENA during Swiss rounds, or the player ranked higher at the end of Swiss rounds during playoff matches - chooses either to play first or to play second."></point>
			<point text="After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether to play first in the next game. They may wait until after sideboarding to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who decided to play or draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.3 Pregame Procedures - MTG ARENA Challenge info">
			<point text="The following steps must be performed in a timely manner before each game begins:"></point>
			<point text="1. Find the MTG Arena Direct Challenge ID of your opponent."></point>
			<point text="2. Open the MTG Arena Game Client and bring up a Direct Challenge."></point>
			<point text="3. Enter your Opponent’s MTG Arena ID. (Note: MTG ARENA IDs are Case Sensitive)"></point>
			<point text="4. Make sure the settings are correct for the Tournament Stage you are playing in (Either Tournament Match or Challenge Match)"></point>
			<point text="5. Select the deck that you registered for the tournament."></point>
			<point text="6. Send the challenge"></point>
			<point text="Once both players have challenged, the MTG Arena Game Client will take over and manage the rest of the process and prompt players through pre-game procedures."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.4 Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches">
			<point text="If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match. A match is considered complete once the result is reported to the Lead Admin. Until that point, either player may concede to or draw with the other, though if the conceding player won a game in the match, the match must be reported as 2-1."></point>
			<point text="Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be considered Bribery (see section 5.2)."></point>
			<point text="If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.5 End-of-Match Procedure">
			<point text="In MTG ARENA, Tournament Challenges give both players 30 minutes to complete their match. This timer is specific to each player, and only ticks down when the player has priority or a decision to make. If a player’s timer runs out, that player is assumed to have lost that game and any remaining games in that match (if necessary)."></point>
			<point text="The Lead Admin of your online tournament may ask Judges to reach out to players in matches that have not reported results after 50 minutes to confirm if they are still playing. Failure to respond may result in penalties. (See point 3.5 - Disconnects)"></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.6 Deck Registration">
			<point text="Players may be required to register their decks and sideboards."></point>
			<point text="Registered decklists record the original composition of each deck and sideboard (if applicable). Once your decklist has been accepted by a Tournament Official, it may not be altered."></point>
			<point text="Players have the right to have access to see their decklist."></point>
			<point text="Decklist submission deadlines will be defined by the Tournament Organizer. By default, decklists are assumed to be due before the start of Round 1, but earlier deadlines may be defined by the Tournament Organizer."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.8 Open / Closed Decklist">
			<point text="Tournaments that require decklists generally have two ways those lists are handled during the event. Decklists are either kept secret from players (Closed Decklist) or they are revealed to players during the tournament (Open Decklist)."></point>
			<point text="All players should have the same level of access to decklists or other information that all other players in the same stage of the event have."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.9 Appeals to the Head Judge">
			<point text="If a player disagrees with a judge’s ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge. The Head Judge may designate additional Appeals Judges who are also empowered to hear appeals."></point>
			<point text="Players may not appeal before the full ruling is made by the responding judge. Rulings made by the Head Judge or designated Appeals Judges are final."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.10 Dropping from a Tournament">
			<point text="Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If a player drops from a tournament before the first round of play has started, they are considered to have not participated in the tournament."></point>
			<point text="Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform the Lead Admin by the means provided for that tournament before the pairings for the next round are generated. Players intending to drop after the Lead Admin begins pairing for the next round will be paired for that round. If a player does not show up for their match, they will be automatically dropped from the tournament unless they report to the Lead Admin. Players that repeatedly and/or intentionally drop from tournaments without informing the Lead Admin of those tournaments may be the subject of penalties up to and including suspension."></point>
			<point text="If a player drops from a tournament after a cut has been made, no other player is advanced as a replacement."></point>
			<point text="If a player drops from a Single or Double Elimination stage of an event after the bracket is generated, that event will continue as planned with the Dropped Player treated as if they are given a Match Loss for any remaining matches they would have to play in the event."></point>
			<point text="Players who have dropped may reenter a tournament at the discretion of the Head Judge."></point>
			<point text="Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive. Doing so is considered Bribery (see section 5.X)."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.11 Taking Notes">
			<point text="Players are allowed to take written notes during a match and may refer to those notes. They are not required to reveal these notes to their opponents."></point>
			<point text="It is common for LAN events to restrict the use of notes. Please be sure to consult the fact sheet for the Tournament to confirm before you begin playing."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="2.12 Video Coverage">
			<point text="Some tournaments use video for live streaming or replay broadcast of matches. Video commentators are considered spectators for the purpose of the tournament. They are responsible for behaving respectfully to all tournament participants during coverage."></point>
			<point text="Some players may choose to broadcast their matches when playing online. Players are permitted to do so, but it is recommended that they broadcast on a 2-minute delay at minimum."></point>
			<point text="Players who are featured on video coverage may have additional procedures they need to do to accommodate being featured. Those procedures will be explained clearly to the player before they begin playing by Tournament Officials. These procedures should not change the level of access to decklists or other information these players have compared to other featured players in the same stage of the tournament."></point>
			<point text="Spectators are also permitted to record matches provided they do so unobtrusively."></point>
			<point text="Judges may ask a player to share their computer screen display of the game client through a chat service that the tournament organizer is utilizing for the operations of a tournament for verification of issues or for validation of a question or concern at any time in which a player is competing in the tournament."></point>
			<point text="The Head Judge may, at their discretion, use video replays to assist in making rulings in tournaments. Video replays may also be used for investigative purposes at a later time."></point>
			<point text="As an added precaution, it is recommended that Organizers require a 2-minute delay at minimum on any live streams to reduce the possibility and effectiveness of seeking or soliciting outside assistance."></point>
		</point>
	</point>
	<point text="3. Tournament Rules">
		<point text="3.1 Tiebreakers">
			<point text="The following tiebreakers are used as the default to determine how a player ranks in a tournament:"></point>
			<point text="1. Match points"></point>
			<point text="2. Opponents’ match-win percentage"></point>
			<point text="3. Game-win percentage"></point>
			<point text="4. Opponents’ game-win percentage"></point>
			<point text="Organizers and platforms may use different Tiebreakers. If they do, those details will be published for their event."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="3.2 Formats Categories">
			<point text="The format of the event calls out what deck construction rules will be used for the event. These are the formats currently supported by this document and available on MTG Arena:"></point>
			<point text="Constructed Formats"></point>
			<point text="• Standard"></point>
			<point text="• Historic"></point>
		</point>
		<point text="3.3 Card Legality - New Releases">
			<point text="Cards become legal for digital tournaments upon their release on MTG Arena."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="3.4 Sideboard">
			<point text="A sideboard is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. The player may use these cards in their main deck during all games after the first one in a match."></point>
			<point text="Players must begin each match with the deck and sideboard in their original compositions."></point>
			<point text="Restrictions on the composition and use of a sideboard can be found in the deck construction rules for a particular format type."></point>
			<point text="If a penalty causes a player to lose the first game in a match before that game has begun, or the first game is intentionally drawn before any cards are played, players may use cards from their sideboard for the next game in the match."></point>
			<point text="Certain cards refer to “a (card or cards) from outside the game.” In tournament play, these are cards in that player’s sideboard."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="3.5 Public and Private Information">
			<point text="For Digital events, there are only two types of information: Public and Private."></point>
			<point text="Public information is anything that is revealed to you by the Game Client. This includes, but is not limited to:"></point>
			<point text="• Life totals."></point>
			<point text="• Counters a player has attached to them."></point>
			<point text="• Continuous effects with no defined expiration within the game that apply to that player, such as Monarch, City’s Blessing, or Emblems."></point>
			<point text="• Unspent mana in a player’s mana pool"></point>
			<point text="• The name of any visible object."></point>
			<point text="• The state (whether it’s tapped, attached to another permanent, face down, etc.) and current zone of any object or player."></point>
			<point text="• Delayed Triggered Abilities that have yet to be put on the stack and resolved."></point>
			<point text="• The game score of the current match."></point>
			<point text="• The current step and/or phase and which player(s) are active"></point>
			<point text="• The number of any kind of objects present in any game zone"></point>
			<point text="• All characteristics of objects in public zones, including the Power and Toughness of creatures."></point>
			<point text="• Information that can be derived by information available in the Game Client."></point>
			<point text="Private information is anything that is not revealed to you by the Game Client. This includes but is not limited to:"></point>
			<point text="• The cards in a player's hand"></point>
			<point text="• Cards revealed to your opponent but not you (ex: Your opponent uses Scry and sees cards and can see whether those revealed cards are on the top or bottom of their deck, but the cards were not revealed to you)"></point>
			<point text="Players are responsible for not actively seeking the Private information of their opponent. Doing so may result in a penalty."></point>
		</point>
	</point>
	<point text="4. Player Communication">
		<point text="Communication between players is essential to the successful play of any game. Most Digital tournaments will advertise a platform where official tournament information will be posted. Players are required to have access to that platform in order to participate in the event."></point>
		<point text="Aside from having access to the defined platform, players must also be responsive to communication from Judges and other Tournament Staff. Because of the nature of Online events, failure to respond to a Tournament Official may result in a penalty (See: Magic Digital IPG 3.5 - Disconnect)"></point>
		<point text="Regardless of anything else, players are expected to treat opponents politely and with respect. Failure to do so may lead to Unsporting Conduct penalties."></point>
	</point>
	<point text="5. Tournament Violations">
		<point text="5.1 Cheating">
			<point text="Cheating will not be tolerated. The Head Judge reviews all cheating allegations, and if they believe that a player has cheated, they will issue the appropriate penalty based on the Digital Infraction Procedure Guide document. All disqualifications are subject to DCI review, and further penalties may be assessed."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="5.2 Bribery">
			<point text="The decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this manner. Making such an offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery. Players may not make any offers to tournament officials in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling."></point>
			<point text="It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may agree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament."></point>
			<point text="It is not bribery when players in the announced last round of the single-elimination portion of a tournament agree to a winner and how to divide the subsequent tournament prizes. In that case, one of the players at each table must agree to drop from the tournament. Players receive the prizes according to their final ranking."></point>
			<point text="The result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily determined through any means other than the normal progress of the game in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, flipping a coin, arm wrestling, or playing any other game."></point>
			<point text="Players may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other matches. Players can make use of information regarding match or game scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their seats during their match or go to great lengths to obtain this information."></point>
			<point text="Players in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering only cash, store credit, prize tickets, and/or unopened product as prizes may, with the permission of the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes evenly. The players may end the tournament at that point or continue to play. All players still in the tournament must agree to the arrangement."></point>
			<example text="Example: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and 3rd and 4th get 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the Tournament Organizer to end the tournament, with each player receiving 7 packs."></example>
			<example text="Example: In the finals of a 1-slot Players Tour Qualifier that offers a travel award and an invitation to the winner, the two finalists may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot alter the results of the match. One player must drop from the tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player who did not drop from the tournament. That player is then free to split the remainder of the prizes as agreed upon. The travel award and invitation are a single item and may not be split."></example>
		</point>
		<point text="5.3 Wagering">
			<point text="Tournament participants, tournament officials, and spectators may not wager, ante, or bet on any portion (including the outcome) of a tournament, match, or game."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="5.4 Unsporting Conduct">
			<point text="Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated at any time. Tournament participants must behave in a polite and respectful manner. Unsporting conduct includes, but is not limited to:"></point>
			<point text="• Using profanity"></point>
			<point text="• Engaging in behavior that could reasonably be expected to create a feeling of being harassed, bullied, or stalked"></point>
			<point text="• Arguing with, acting belligerently toward, or insulting tournament officials, players or spectators"></point>
			<point text="• Violating the personal privacy or safety of any participant, including spectators and staff"></point>
			<point text="• Using social media or public chats to bully, shame, or intimidate other participants"></point>
			<point text="• Failing to follow the instructions of a tournament official"></point>
			<point text="Officials are expected to investigate potential matters brought to their attention as soon as possible and take actions to discourage repeat behavior. All incidents of unsporting conduct are subject to further review."></point>
		</point>
		<point text="5.5 Slow Play">
			<point text="For most matches, players play using the Tournament Match feature which has a timer that will limit the time each player can take to make choices. However, some events will use the Challenge Match, which does not have a timer in-client. In these cases, all players still have the responsibility to play at a reasonable pace.

	<point text="Appendix B—Round Timing">
		<point text="In MTG Arena, using Tournament Challenge gives each player a 30-minute clock. It is recommended that you use this method to manage time whenever possible."></point>
		<point text="The following are recommended times for when Judges should reach out to players who have not reported a result for each round of a tournament:"></point>
		<point text="• Constructed and Limited tournaments—60 minutes"></point>
		<point text="• Single-elimination quarterfinal or semifinal matches—90 minutes"></point>
		<point text="• Single-elimination final matches—no time limit"></point>
		<point text="If a player fails to respond to the Judge who reached out to them after this time, they may be subject to penalties. (See: Magic Digital IPG 3.5 - Disconnects)"></point>
		<point text="As a note, these are not time limits for players to complete their matches, they are only times that Judges should begin verifying that players are still playing."></point>
		<point text="The Head Judge of the tournament is the final authority on time limits for a tournament. However, any deviation from these recommendations must be announced prior to and during tournament registration."></point>
		<point text="Magic Premier Tournaments may have different time limits. These time limits can be found in the tournament or tournament series fact sheet."></point>
