	<point text="Introduction">
		<point text="The DCI is a worldwide organization dedicated to organized play. It promotes, enforces, and develops rules and policies using the goals and philosophies defined in this document, the Magic: The Gathering Infraction Procedure Guide, and the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document. It constantly reviews these rules and policies to ensure its goals are met."></point>
		<point text="There are two types of sanctioned Magic tournament: rated and casual."></point>
		<point text="The purpose of this document is to provide the infrastructure used to run Magic: The Gathering (“Magic”) tournaments by defining appropriate rules, responsibilities, and procedures to be followed in all DCI-sanctioned Magic tournaments. "></point>
		<point text="DCI-sanctioned tournaments are to be run consistently regardless of their location. This ensures equal treatment of players in different regions and enables their smooth transition to international tournaments. All players are treated equally and share responsibilities according to the Rules Enforcement Level (REL) of the tournament. Both players and officials should cooperate to achieve their common goal of running a proper DCI-sanctioned tournament. Players and officials must treat each other in a fair and respectful manner, following both the rules and the spirit in which those rules were created. They are responsible for following the most current version of the Magic Tournament Rules and Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules. Spectators have their own set of responsibilities. Individuals violating DCI rules are subject to penalties defined by the appropriate document for the tournament’s Rules Enforcement Level."></point>
		<point text="Information in this document may contradict (or have information not contained in) the Comprehensive Rules. In such cases, this document takes precedence."></point>
		<point text="Official tournament fact sheets located on the Wizards of the Coast website for specific tournaments may define alternative or additional policies or procedures. If a contradiction exists between this document and an official fact sheet located on the Wizards of the Coast website, the information in the fact sheet takes precedence."></point>
		<point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to alter these rules, as well as the right to interpret, modify, clarify, or otherwise issue official changes to these rules without prior notice."></point>
		<point text="2019 updates to this document are scheduled to be announced the Monday after each Prerelease. There may be additional dates in which updates to the legality of individual cards in formats contained in this document will be announced. Those dates will be communicated with at least 4 weeks’ notice. Other updates not involving updates to face legality may occur without prior announcement."></point>

    <point text="1. Tournament Fundamentals">
        <point text="1.1 Tournament Types">
            <point text="Sanctioned, rated tournaments are divided into two types: Premier and non-Premier. Premier tournaments are run by Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament Organizers. They have unique names and features. Non-Premier tournaments are tournaments that are not explicitly Premier."></point>
            <annotation text="Premier tournaments currently include Magic: The Gathering World Championship, World Magic Cup, World Magic Cup Qualifiers, World Magic Cup Qualifier Trials, Pro Tour, Regional Pro Tour Qualifier, Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier, Grand Prix, Grand Prix Trial, WPN Premium Tournament, and WPN Premium Qualifier. Non-Premier tournaments include any other sanctioned tournaments. Premier tournaments are listed on the Wizards of the Coast website. The MTR is a policy document for both Premier and non-Premier sanctioned tournaments."></annotation>
            <point text="There are two major tournament formats: Limited and Constructed. Each has rules specific to its format. In Limited tournaments, all product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed tournaments, players compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some Premier tournaments may consist of multiple formats within the same tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Limited formats include any format in which a player constructs a deck during the event — e.g., draft, sealed deck, and mini masters. Constructed formats include any format in which a player constructs their deck before the event. The most popular constructed formats are Standard, Modern, and Legacy."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.2 Publishing Tournament Information">
            <point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish DCI-sanctioned tournament information at any time (including during the tournament). Tournament information includes, but is not limited to, the contents of one or more players' decks, descriptions of strategies or play, transcripts, and video reproductions. Tournament Organizers are also allowed to publish this information once their tournament is complete."></point>
            <annotation text="Decklists should not be made public until an event has completed except in certain Premier events where player decklists are often shared with opponents at the beginning of the round. This is to minimize advantage created by certain lists being made public by coverage. Wizards of the Coast’s right to publish this information does not necessarily mean judge or Tournament Organizers have to record it."></annotation>
            <annotation text="At Premier events like Grand Prix and Pro Tours, Wizards of the Coast often has online coverage of the event. This section is just to confirm they are allowed to publish lists. Tournament Organizers also have the right to publish this information after the event ends, but some TOs have gotten permission to handle the coverage the same way. For example, Star City Games Opens regularly publish decklists on the Star City Games website during the event or Top 8."></annotation>
            <point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish penalty and suspension information."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges should take all investigation and penalty information very seriously, as it could end up in an article on Wizards of the Coast’s webpage."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Wizards of the Coast will often report on disqualifications or other high profile penalties during Pro Tours."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Wizards of the Coast also regularly publishes a list of people who are suspended from the game. They sometimes write articles about more controversial suspensions, but most of the time just update the list of suspended players."></annotation>
        </point>
		<point text="1.3 Tournament Roles">
            <point text="The following roles are defined for tournament purposes:"></point>
            <point text="• Tournament Organizer"></point>
            <point text="• Head Judge"></point>
            <point text="• Floor Judge"></point>
            <point text="• Scorekeeper"></point>
            <point text="• Player"></point>
            <point text="• Spectator"></point>
            <point text="The first four roles above are considered tournament officials. The Head Judge and floor judges are collectively considered judges. A single individual may act in any combination of tournament official roles. Individuals who are not judges at a tournament are spectators in any match in which they are not playing. Members of the press are also considered spectators."></point>
            <annotation text="One individual may perform all six roles during a tournament. At larger events these roles are usually divvied up. Any player is a spectator of the matches taking place in nearby seats. All individuals that are not judges at an event, including those with or without a DCI number, are considered spectators."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players are expected to follow all instruction given by Tournament Officials, therefore it’s important to know who that title applies to. It’s also important to define each of these roles in detail, which luckily the MTR does for us in Sections 1.6-1.11, in the order listed above."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.4 Participation Eligibility">
            <point text="Anyone is eligible to participate as a player in a DCI-sanctioned tournament except for:"></point>
            <point text="• Individuals currently suspended by the DCI. The current DCI suspended player list is located at http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/suspended. Individuals currently suspended from the DCI may not act as tournament officials;"></point>
            <point text="• Other individuals specifically prohibited from participation by DCI or Wizards of the Coast policy (such determination is at Wizards of the Coast’s sole discretion);"></point>
            <annotation text="This is kind of the definition of suspended or banned."></annotation>
            <point text="• Individuals thirteen (13) years of age and younger who do not have their parent/guardians’ permission;"></point>
            <annotation text="Thirteen is the recommended age for the game provided by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast."></annotation>
            <point text="• Anyone prohibited by federal, state, or local laws, the rules of the Tournament Organizer, or by a venue’s management."></point>
            <annotation text="Federal, state, and local laws supersede any rules set forth by Wizards of the Coast. For example, if a player isn’t allowed within 500 ft of a particular store, employee, or other players because of a restraining order or some other legal limitations, he or she can’t play. Being able to play is a privilege, not a right, and extenuating legal circumstance may prevent people from playing."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The store owner has the right to bar anyone from their store or venue for any reason they see fit. Typically store owners only use this as a last resort for recurring problems players, or in the case of theft. They are explicitly allowed to do so by Wizards of the Coast, so they don’t have to worry about a player complaining to Wizards of the Coast to get retribution."></annotation>
            <point text="• Tournament Organizers may choose to age restrict any Regular REL events that they organize. They must clearly indicate this in their marketing for the event on the Store and Event Locator description as well as any other place they display the event information. (i.e. Tournament Organizers may advertise an age 16 and under Friday Night Magic)."></point>
            <point text="Anyone is eligible to participate as a tournament official (Tournament Organizer, Head Judge, floor judge or Scorekeeper) for a tournament except for:"></point>
            <point text="• Individuals currently suspended by the DCI;"></point>
            <annotation text="If someone is suspended as a player, they aren’t allowed to judge either. Keep in mind, this does not directly correspond with judge certification. Just as non-certified individuals can act as judges for the event, being suspended does not directly revoke your certification, though it may be taken into consideration."></annotation>
            <point text="Anyone who has played in the tournament, unless it is a tournament that explicitly allows tournament officials to play while acting as a tournament official."></point>
            <point text="Tournament officials may play in a DCI-sanctioned, rated tournament for which they are a tournament official if (and only if) the tournament is of the following types:"></point>
            <point text="• Friday Night Magic"></point>
            <point text="• Prerelease"></point>
            <point text="• Magic Weekend"></point>
            <point text="• Other non-Premier Magic Tournaments"></point>
            <point text="• Tournaments in which the official Wizards of the Coast tournament fact sheet specifically permits officials of that tournament to play"></point>
            <point text="If one or more tournament officials play in the tournament, it must be run at Regular Rules Enforcement Level. If tournament officials play in the tournament and the tournament is not one of the allowed types listed above, the tournament will be invalidated. Tournament officials are required to officiate tournaments fairly and without regard to their own self-interest."></point>
            <point text="The owners of organizations that run Premier Events are not permitted to play in those tournaments, even if the owner is not listed as a tournament official (organizer, judge, and/or scorekeeper) for that tournament."></point>
            <point text="Premier Events include the following tournaments: Magic: The Gathering World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, WPN Qualifiers, WPN Preliminary Events, Players Tour Qualifiers, Magic Premier Series, Grand Prix, Grand Prix Trials."></point>
            <point text="Some tournaments have additional criteria regarding player and tournament official eligibility (e.g. invitation-only tournaments, such as Players Tour, and Players Tour Finals)."></point>
            <point text="The Players Tour Invitation Policy defines specific eligibility rules with regards to certain types of invitationonly Premier Tournaments (e.g. Players Tour, and Players Tour Finals)."></point>
            <point text="Individuals with questions regarding their tournament eligibility should contact the DCI policy manager via (esports@wizards.com)."></point>
            <annotation text="All Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level events require players and judges to be separate people, because of the potential problems it could cause. If someone were playing against the person judging the event at a large cash prize event, it might make them less confident in the judge’s ability to remain impartial, especially if they need to ask a question about a face in their hand."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Several years ago, even Regular Rules Enforcement Level required judges and players to be separate, which caused many people to not want to become judges at all, as it then meant they could only rarely play. For a while there was also a “3 Judge Rule” which meant if there were 3 judges, they could play and judge since there would always be a judge not involved in the match that could be called."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The “tournaments in which the official Wizards of the Coast tournament fact sheet specifically permits officials of that tournament to play” does not have anything under that category, but is an option for the future. The general policy is that all Regular Rules Enforcement Level events someone can both play and act as a Tournament Official, for Competitive and Professional they cannot."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.5 DCI Numbers">
            <point text="Tournament participants must provide their DCI number to the Scorekeeper during registration."></point>
            <annotation text="It is worth mentioning that just because the scorekeeping software allows someone to be entered with no trouble, that does not necessarily mean they are eligible. Wizards Event Reporter currently does not keep an active, up to date registry of the suspended players list. Judges, Tournament Organizers, and Scorekeepers are encouraged to check the list regularly to be aware of potentially suspended players in their area."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The DCI number also helps uniquely identify players in an event where multiple people can have the same name."></annotation>
            <point text=" Players without a DCI number should obtain one from https://accounts.wizards.com/ before attending an event. If a player does not obtain a DCI number before the event, the Tournament Organizer of the event can provide one. Players are only allowed one DCI membership number, and players with multiple DCI numbers should contact Wizards of the Coast to have the information for two or more DCI numbers combined."></point>
            <annotation text="Players without a DCI number should obtain one from https://accounts.wizards.com/ before attending an event. If a player does not obtain a DCI number before the event, the Tournament Organizer of the event can provide one. Players are only allowed one DCI membership number, and players with multiple DCI numbers should contact Wizards of the Coast to have the information for two or more DCI numbers combined."></annotation>
            <annotation text="If a player ends up with more than one DCI number, they can merge memberships online. Nevertheless, players may not intentionally maintain multiple memberships (e.g., in order to play while their main number is suspended). Players are also required to use their real names, that they use in real life. Their registered names don’t have to be their full legal names; a player may register as “Mike” instead of Michael but can’t register as “Roflcopter McGee.” The registered name should be what the player identifies as their name."></annotation>
            <point text="Results containing temporary player numbers, temporary player names, or placeholders should not be reported to the DCI."></point>
            <annotation text="Fake player accounts and incorrect names cannot exist in the results sent to the DCI. An example of this would be Grand Prix events with “Sleep in special” offers made to players with Byes. Since the players won’t be at the player meeting, scorekeepers often change their name to “zzzzzLastName, FirstNamezzzz” so that person is sat at the end of the list for the player meeting, so there are no gaps in the players actually there."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Some Tournament Organizers may add a fake player in order to sanction an event with 7 players. This is strictly prohibited. If only 7 people show up for an event, players can still play, but the event must be run as an unsanctioned event. See MTR 10.1 for more information on participation minimums."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.6 Tournament Organizer">
            <point text="The Tournament Organizer of a tournament is responsible for all tournament logistics including:"></point>
            <point text="• Securing a sanctioning number from the DCI."></point>
            <annotation text="This is obtained by sanctioning the event in Wizards Event Reporter, through the creation of the event. Each event has a unique sanctioning number."></annotation>
            <point text="• Providing a site for the tournament that meets the tournament’s expected needs."></point>
            <annotation text="To ensure a smooth running event, the tournament organizer must provide a play space that will allow the event to have space required for the expected number of players. This may range from the store they run having enough room for their FNM, or renting out a room in a hotel or convention center to make adequate space."></annotation>
            <point text="• Advertising the tournament in advance of the tournament date."></point>
            <annotation text="In order to ensure that players are available to participate in the tournament, we need to ensure that it is advertised when and where the event is happening. This can range from making sure the event shows up in Wizards Store &amp; Event Locator, to promoting the event on Facebook and other social media, to having large ads on magic related websites."></annotation>
            <point text="• Staffing the tournament with appropriate tournament officials."></point>
            <annotation text="Tournament Organizers need to ensure that they have properly qualified tournament officials to staff the event. For example, Grand Prix Trials require at least one Level 1 judge staffing the event, and Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers require at least one Level 2 judge. Additional staff may be needed for the event to run efficiently and at a reasonable pace."></annotation>
            <point text="• Providing all materials necessary to operate the tournament (e.g. product for Limited format tournaments)."></point>
            <annotation text="Tournament Organizers need to ensure that sealed product and other required materials are available for limited format tournaments and that deck list sheets available for constructed tournaments. Those are pretty straightforward. The Tournament Organizer is also responsible for providing a lot of other things that players may take for granted — e.g., a computer and printer to take results and print pairings, tape, places to post pairings, round clock, and scissors/paper cutter to cut results slips. Some of these aren’t required but make the event go smoother, and typical Tournament Organizers will provide these. Some may find alternate ways to do some of the tasks these are used for, such as using a large TV to display pairings."></annotation>
            <point text="• Reporting the tournament results to the DCI."></point>
            <point text="• Saving match result slips from each tournament for a period of 6 months (to aid in match appeals)."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="1.7 Head Judge">
            <point text="Sanctioned tournaments require the physical presence of a Head Judge during play to adjudicate disputes, interpret rules, and make other official decisions. The Head Judge is the final judicial authority at any DCIsanctioned tournament and all tournament participants are expected to follow their interpretations. Although it is beneficial, the Head Judge does not have to be certified."></point>
            <annotation text="The Head Judge of a tournament is not necessarily a certified Judge. Often the Head Judge of an event will simply be a store employee or the Tournament Organizer themselves. Most Competitive Rules Enforcement Level events will have a certified Head Judge but this is not necessarily required. Note that some events require Head Judges of particular levels. See the WPN site for judge level requirements."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge’s responsibilities include:"></point>
            <point text="• Ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deal with game or policy rule violations that they notice or are brought to their attention."></point>
            <annotation text="In larger events the Head Judge may not be the primary individual fielding judge calls. Sometimes the Head Judge will be handling other tournament aspects and be unable to take calls, or the Head Judge will be trying to let an available Floor Judge answer the call. One reason for the latter is to maintain a chain of appeals, allowing players to receive an initial ruling from a Floor Judge and have the option to appeal to the Head Judge to either confirm the initial ruling or reverse the ruling the player objected to. "></annotation>
            <annotation text="The Head Judge should be a ready resource for Floor Judges. One of the more important things a Head Judge can do here is discussing a missed call with a player. If a Floor Judge incorrectly answers a call, or an appeal is handled incorrectly the Head Judge should absolutely address that with the players involved."></annotation>
            <point text="• Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a floor judge."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are allowed to appeal the decision of any Floor Judge to the Head Judge. The Head Judge is the final arbiter of all rulings and sometimes that will mean reversing the decision of a Floor Judge. If a decision is reversed, it is vital that the Head Judge explain the reasoning behind the reversal to both the players and the judge."></annotation>
            <point text="• Coordinating and delegating tasks to floor judges as needed."></point>
            <annotation text="In tournaments with multiple judges, the Head Judge is responsible for assigning and organizing Team Leads and teams. The Head Judge creates the teams (at big events sometimes with the assistance of the Tournament Organizer or Judge Manager), and makes sure everyone’s tasks are understood. The Head Judge is also responsible for overseeing other judges at the event. Not all tasks assigned are always strictly tournament operations and may be other things needed by the organizer."></annotation>
            <point text="If necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer their duties to any judge if they are unable to fulfill them for a period of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances, if the tournament’s integrity would be damaged otherwise, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head Judge."></point>
            <annotation text="At store level events this is most common during lunch breaks but this can also happen if the Head Judge becomes ill or ends their shift and a new Head Judge takes over. This is incredibly rare for Premier events but for side events the person acting as Head Judge may be more fluid. The Tournament Organizer has final say about whether the Head Judge needs to be replaced due to exceptional circumstances."></annotation>
            <point text="Certain Premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or different Head Judges for different portions of the tournament. All Head Judges share the same responsibilities and exercise the same authority while they are serving as a Head Judge."></point>
            <annotation text="Large events will often have several judges acting as Head Judges (usually noted by wearing burgundy judge shirts at Premier events or red at Star City Games events). It is also possible that a tournament may be organized into multiple flights, each with its own Head Judge. No Head Judge is more ‘ahead’ of another and each of their rulings is final. Each of the Head Judges can take appeals, run investigations, and satisfy all of the other duties that the Head Judge of record is afforded."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.8 Floor Judges">
            <point text="Floor judges are available to players and spectators to answer questions, deal with illegal plays, or assist with reasonable requests. They do not have to be certified."></point>
            <annotation text="When it comes down to it, the biggest responsibility of Floor Judges is to be there to answer questions, fix play errors, and providing other assistance to help the event to run. They are the lifeblood of the event. Floor Judges at events, both at Competitive and Regular Rules Enforcement Level, do not need to be certified in order to judge at an event, however it is recommended that the judges at higher level events be certified or be working toward certification."></annotation>
            <point text="Judges will not generally assist players in determining the current game state but can answer questions about the rules, interactions between cards, or provide the Oracle™ wordings of relevant cards."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges are able to answer questions about the rules and interactions between cards as long as they do not provide strategic advice regarding plays to make in a situation. Oracle text is the authoritative rules text for a face. Oracle text can be found on gatherer.wizards.com, but many other sources such as phone apps will have up to date Oracle text as well. More reading on what type of information judges can assist with is available in section 4.1."></annotation>
            <point text="At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, the judge may assist the player in understanding the game state in the interest of education."></point>
            <annotation text="Regular Rules Enforcement Level events provides an entry into the game for players. As a result, players may ask judges what the game state is and why something is the way it is. The emphasis is on education and helping new players, and there are likely smaller prizes on the line. This doesn’t mean the judge can tell the player what they should do, but the judge may assist a player in understanding a more complex interaction or game state in a less formal way than at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player wishes to ask their question away from the table, the request will usually be honored."></point>
            <annotation text="If the player wants to ask a question that they feels may give too much information to their opponent, the player may ask to have the question answered away from the table. A good habit for judges is to stand far enough away so opponents cannot hear them or the player asking for assistance."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not request specific judges to answer their calls but may request a tournament official to help translate. This request may be honored at the discretion of the original judge."></point>
            <annotation text="Players may not request that a specific judge answer their call, as it would compromise tournament integrity and give the impression of partiality. But there are tournaments throughout the world, and players may not speak the local language. If there are tournament officials that speak the player’s language,they may help to translate in order to ensure clear and efficient communication. At international events like an European Grand Prix, there is often a list of judges who speak different languages as a resource provided to Scorekeepers and Judge Managers."></annotation>
            <point text="Judges do not intervene in a game to prevent illegal actions but do intervene as soon as a rule has been broken or to prevent a situation from escalating."></point>
            <annotation text="Like in other sports, judges aren’t there to prevent mistakes. However, as soon as a game infraction happens, judges step in and apply the necessary corrections and penalties. Judges may step in if they believe a tense situation would otherwise escalate to unsportsmanlike conduct."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.9 Scorekeeper">
            <point text="The Scorekeeper ensures the correct generation of pairings and all other tournament records throughout the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="EThis includes both match slips and every sanction issued by a judge during the tournament. Scorekeepers usually keep slips separated and organized in round pairs, so if a problem arises they have both electronic (on WER) and paper copies of relevant documents."></annotation>
            <point text="The Scorekeeper’s responsibilities include:"></point>
            <point text="• Generating correct pairings each round and accurately entering the results of those rounds."></point>
            <point text="• Generating standings for posting before and after the final Swiss round. Other rounds may also be posted at the Head Judge’s discretion."></point>
            <point text="• Solving all scorekeeping problems that arise in consultation with the Head Judge."></point>
            <point text="• Making sure all necessary information is included in the tournament’s report to be submitted to the DCI."></point>
            <annotation text="While scorekeeping might seem simple, ensuring that the results of each match are correctly kept is crucial to guarantee that the tournament runs as smooth as possible."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Tournament Organizers are usually the Scorekeepers of smaller events like Grand Prix Trials, but in larger events a judge often takes the responsibility of scorekeeping. Larger Premier events often have professional Scorekeepers who are experienced with scorekeeping software. Their scorekeeping ability does not correlate to their judge level; some professional Scorekeepers are uncertified, and others are Level 2+ judges."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge has the final authority in determining corrective action for scorekeeping errors."></point>
            <annotation text="In the event of any issue with the pairings at any given round, the Head Judge may dictate a solution they see fit. In the end, the Head Judge is the final decision maker when it comes to the running of the event."></annotation>

            <point text="• Behaving in a respectful manner toward tournament officials, other tournament participants, and spectators and refraining from unsporting conduct at all times."></point>
            <annotation text="Examples of behavior which are considered unsporting are found here. Players are otherwise expected to treat others with some level of respect."></annotation>
            <point text="• Maintaining a clear and legal game state."></point>
            <annotation text="Playing Magic can sometimes be complex, sometimes stressful, and sometimes frustrating, but still that’s not an excuse for a judge not penalizing a player for playing unclearly. Comprehension, legality and clarity are the most important things in a Magic game, for they can be the difference between no penalization and a Disqualification. There is a specific section about Maintaining the Game State in the IPG."></annotation>
            <point text="• Complying with announced start times and time limits."></point>
            <annotation text="Tournaments are always organized to run in a timely fashion, and Tournament Officials (judges and organizers) look to keep them running smoothly and quickly. If no extenuating situations appear, players are expected to follow every time limit to keep the tournament flowing. There is a specific section about Tardiness in the IPG."></annotation>
            <point text="• Calling attention to any rules or policy infraction they notice in their matches. "></point>
            <annotation text="Judges can’t be everywhere all the time, so players are encouraged to cooperate in maintaining a legal and clear game. Any rules and/or policy infraction should be pointed out to any judge as soon as noticed. This way we can all enjoy of a healthy and correct game! Failing to notice mistakes quickly may lead to Warnings (see IPG 2.6), and intentionally ignoring them can be much worse (see IPG 4.8)."></annotation>
            <point text="• Bringing to a judge’s attention any discrepancies in their tournament match record."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a very important responsibility. Players are required to inform a judge immediately if they are offered a bribe, or asked to record an improper game result. Failing to do so may result in a severe penalty for both the player offering and the player who did not call attention to the illegal action. Additionally, any errors that have been made in results entry should be brought to a Tournament Official’s attention as soon as they are noticed."></annotation>
            <point text="• Informing the DCI of any discrepancies in their overall match history or rankings as soon as they become aware of it. If players believe there is an anomaly in their match history or ranking they should refer to the Magic: The Gathering Event Appeals Policy, located at:"></point>
            <link text="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-event-appeals-policy"></link>
			<annotation text="Sometimes the ranking system gets flooded with information or due to a malfunction may show the incorrect position and/or quantity of points. If this should happen, any player may report the mistake or the malfunction in order to correct it. Wizards of the Coast and the DCI are always looking forward to feedback from the community."></annotation>
            <point text="• Having a single DCI membership number. Individuals holding more than one number must contact Wizards of the Coast Customer Service at http://www.wizards.com/customerservice so that their numbers can be merged."></point>
            <annotation text="The DCI membership number is a player’s identity for tournaments and organized Magic: The Gathering events. Without one, a player can’t get registered in any DCI-sanctioned event. Also, every result and every point earned will go the account linked to that membership number. That is why it’s important to have only one DCI number."></annotation>
            <point text="• Refraining from enrolling in tournaments in which they are not allowed by policy to participate."></point>
            <annotation text="Some tournaments award invitations to other events or have participation restrictions based on level, players’ invitation history, or other factors. Players are required to be aware of their eligibility and should not intentionally enter events they are ineligible for."></annotation>
            <point text="• Being familiar with the rules contained within this document."></point>
            <annotation text="Yes, judges do know how to handle rules and how to interpret them. But players are responsible for at least know something about the rules contained in the game. After all, if they don’t know how to play Magic, why would they go to a Magic tournament? Notice, this is stated in the MTR, but not in the IPG. We expect players to know and adhere to Tournament Rules, but they don’t need to know what infraction or penalties are. Some violations of the MTR, such as Bribery, Collusion, and Improperly Determining a Winner, all involve penalties that will be applied whether or not the players know the relevant rules."></annotation>
            <point text="• Being physically present for the tournament."></point>
            <point text="A player must bring the following items to a tournament in order to participate:"></point>
            <point text="• A physical, visible, and reliable method to maintain and record game information (tokens, score counters, pen and paper, and so on)."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are responsible for maintaining a clear and legal game state. Therefore players must bring items that help keep a clear game state — e.g., pen and paper for life totals, dice for counters and actual mana pool, tokens, etc."></annotation>
            <point text="• A valid DCI membership number registered in the participant’s name. New players may register for DCI membership when enrolling in the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="The DCI number identifies players at events, so every player must have their DCI number registration. It’s not necessary to have the face physically at hand for tournament enrolling, but it is also helpful."></annotation>
            <point text="• Any materials specifically required for a particular tournament format, such as assembled decks and/or decklists for constructed tournaments."></point>
            <annotation text="Some tournaments require players to have certain items in order to play, e.g., a decklists and constructed decks. Decklists help maintain an event’s integrity and provide information about the decks played at the tournament and their legality."></annotation>
            <point text="Players retain their responsibilities even if a judge provides them with extra assistance. "></point>
            <annotation text="Players may request a judge’s assistance to comply with their responsibilities as a player. For example, during the pool registration portion of a limited event, a judge may step in to help a struggling player register their pool to get the event moving. Nevertheless, the player still needs to fulfill with his responsibilities as best they can."></annotation>
            <point text="The individual members of a team are considered players, and are equally responsible for required tournament procedures, such as accurately filling out their match result slips. Players are only responsible for the games they play themselves and not separate games being played by their teammates but are expected to point out rules violations they observe in their teammates’ matches."></point>
            <annotation text="Individual players on a team must comply with the same tournament procedures as players not playing on a team but should not be held responsible for their teammates’ errors, However that doesn’t mean they can ignore errors if they see them. If they see a problem with one of their team mates games they cannot deliberately ignore it."></annotation>
            <point text="Players who do not fulfill their responsibilities may be subject to penalties and review by the DCI. Wizards of the Coast and the DCI reserve the right to suspend or revoke a player's membership without prior notice for any reason they deem necessary."></point>
            <annotation text="This is the big ultimatum. Not complying with a required responsibility consciously may end in a penalty and also a review or an investigation conducted by the judges at the event and/or the DCI itself. No player may interfere with the integrity of a tournament under any circumstances."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.11 Espectadores">
            <point text="Any person physically present at a tournament and not in any other category above is a spectator. Spectators are responsible for remaining silent and passive during matches and other official tournament sections in which players are also required to be silent."></point>
            <annotation text="This is important to maintain the venue as comfortable as possible to players during their matches, and preventing any chance of outside assistance from any comment or making players lose focus by creating excessive noise."></annotation>
            <point text="If spectators believe they have observed a rules or policy violation, they are encouraged to alert a judge as soon as possible. At Regular or Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, spectators are permitted to ask the players to pause the match while they alert a judge. At Professional Rules Enforcement Level, spectators who are not members of the official coverage team must not interfere with the match directly"></point>
            <annotation text="Judges are people, and sometimes errors or even suspicious events are missed. Spectators may pause the match at Regular and Competitive Rules Enforcement Level. Spectators may often mistakenly identify an action or board state as illegal (often with missed triggers), so it’s important that a judge gets involved as soon as possible and that spectators give no information to the players during their match. For more information on different Rules Enforcement Levels, see MTR 1.12."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Members of the coverage team are allowed to bring attention to the judge staff about possible problems with the game."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may request that a spectator not observe their matches. Such requests must be made through a judge. Tournament officials may also instruct a spectator not observe a match or matches"></point>
            <annotation text="Some spectators might be scouting other players or even talking too much. Players can request a judge to keep spectators away from their matches. Judges typically will try to honor a request, but we reserve the right to refuse if the request is unreasonable."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.12 Rules Enforcement Levels">
            <point text="Rules Enforcement Levels (REL) are a means to communicate to the players and judges what expectations they can have of the tournament in terms of rigidity of rules enforcement, technically correct play, and procedures used."></point>
            <annotation text="The mindset and attitude of the average player and the standard of behavior judges and other players can expect are different at each Rules Enforcement Level. From the most casual to most stringent the Rules Enforcement Levels are: Regular Rules Enforcement Level, Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, and Professional Rules Enforcement Level."></annotation>
            <point text="The Rules Enforcement Level of a tournament generally reflects the prizes awarded and the distance a player may be expected to travel."></point>
            <annotation text="For example, FNM is run at Regular Rules Enforcement Level, draws from the store’s local player community, and often offers one or two booster packs per player as the prize pool. Preliminary PTQs, on the other hand, are run at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, can draw players from up to a few hours away, and often have cash prizes as well as an invitation to a Regional PTQ. Day two of Grand Prix and the Pro Tour are run at Professional Rules Enforcement Level, draw players from around the world, and offer substantial cash prizes."></annotation>
            <point text="The appropriate Rules Enforcement Level for specific programs is listed in Appendix F."></point>
            <title text="Regular"></title>
            <point text="Regular tournaments are focused on fun and social aspects, not enforcement. Most tournaments are run at this level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may have heard of policy and what is “really bad,” but generally play in a fashion similar to the way they do casually. Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over technically precise play. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document, located at:"></point>
			<link text="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-judging-regular-rel"></link>
            <annotation text="This is one step above kitchen-table Magic. Note that the IPG does not apply at Regular Rules Enforcement Level. Instead, we use the Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level (JAR) document, which lays the groundwork for a fun, casual atmosphere where only repeat offenders and serious problems —like cheating, aggressive behavior, bribery, and theft— are punished. Instead of punishing players for innocent tournament and play errors, it’s our job as judges at Regular Rules Enforcement Level to help them learn the right way to play so that they can succeed at higher Rules Enforcement Level tournaments."></annotation>
            <title text="Competitive"></title>
            <point text="Competitive tournaments are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional tournaments. Players are expected to know the game’s rules and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are tournaments that protect the interests of all players by providing tournament integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with Professional-level tournament structure, proper procedures, and rules. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located at:"></point>
			<link text="http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infractionprocedure-guide"></link>
            <annotation text="This is the Rules Enforcement Level at which most competitive magic tournaments are run. Grand Prix Trials, Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers, Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, and the first day of Grand Prix are all run at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level. Tighter technical play and clearer communication are both important at this level, and tournament and game play infractions are penalized according to the IPG."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Deck registration is required (MTR 2.7), and judges must perform deck checks during the tournament (MTR 2.7). Players are required to shuffle their opponents’ decks after their owners have shuffled them (MTR 3.9), and certain types of sleeves are prohibited (MTR 3.10)."></annotation>
            <annotation text="With certain exceptions players may not use electronic devices capable of taking and storing notes, communicating with other people, or accessing the internet during the drafting, deck construction, or playing of matches (MTR 2.12)."></annotation>
            <title text="Professional"></title>
            <point text="Professional level tournaments offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great distances.

    <point text="2. Tournament Mechanics">
        <point text="2.1 Match Structure">
            <point text="A Magic match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games, usually two. Drawn games do not count toward this goal."></point>
            <annotation text="Most matches are usually won as 2-0 or 2-1. Matches that are 1-1-1 before the round ends should move onto a fourth game since neither side has won the set number of games. Two Headed Giant matches, unlike regular two player matches, are best of 1 matches."></annotation>
            <point text="If the round ends before a player has won the required number of games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point."></point>
            <annotation text="If the round has ended and only one player has won a game then that player is the winner of that match because they have won the majority of games."></annotation>
            <point text="If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw."></point>
            <annotation text="If the round has ended and the result is 1-1 or 1-1-1 then the match is a draw."></annotation>
            <point text="The Tournament Organizer may change the required number of games to be won for any portion of the tournament as long as this choice is announced before the tournament begins."></point>
            <annotation text="For example, the Pro Tour finals are played until one player wins three games. This is commonly known as “best of five,” though if games are drawn there can be more than 5 games. Note that this is typically not done outside of the Pro Tour or specially advertised events."></annotation>
            <point text="Match results, not individual game results, are reported to the DCI."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="2.2 Play/Draw Rule">
            <point text="For the first game of a match, a designated player - the winner of a random method (such as a die roll or coin toss) during Swiss rounds, or the player ranked higher at the end of Swiss rounds during playoff matches - chooses either to play first or to play second."></point>
            <annotation text="For non-Playoff matches, both players must agree on the random method. This can get a little tricky when the players don’t agree on the method (such as rolling a spindown dice) so feel free to step in and help players select a random method like odds and evens or something similar."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Higher ranked choosing is now just the default rule for any single elimination portion of a tournament. This only applies to the initial choice during the match. After the first game, the loser of the previous game makes the choice. This rule was created to give more value to those who did better in the Swiss portion of the event, giving some advantage to “playing it out” rather than intentionally drawing in, which means people playing more Magic!"></annotation>
            <point text="They must state this choice before looking at their hand. If they state no choice, it is assumed that they are playing first."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are supposed to decide whether they want to play or draw before looking at their opening hands, since the contents could influence their decision greatly. If someone does not announce their choice before seeing their opening hand, they gain information would could impact their decision. This is a fairly common and innocent mistake, so there is a simple solution; the player who sees their opener before declaring plays first by default."></annotation>
            <point text="The player who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. This is referred to as the play/draw rule."></point>
            <annotation text="For more information on this, check out CR 103.7, which covers the beginning of the game."></annotation>
            <point text="After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether to play first in the next game. They may wait until after sideboarding to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who decided to play or draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses."></point>
            <annotation text="Games that have ended in a draw have functionally not happened. There is thus no need to rechoose, as we are instead merely beginning the act of playing again. Thus, if the previous game ended in a draw, the player who chose last chooses again."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="2.3 Pregame Procedures">
            <point text="The following steps must be performed in a timely manner before each game begins:"></point>
            <annotation text="The term “timely” here is important. Players cannot take excessive time sideboarding or shuffling, or they may be subject to Slow Play or Stalling penalties."></annotation>
            <point text="1. If sideboarding is allowed, players may remove cards from their decks and add cards from their sideboards."></point>
            <annotation text="Sideboarding is allowed between games only when a previous game had actions taken during it. A tournament should test a player’s skill in deck building and technical play first, not in advance scouting opponents. A player may not offer to intentionally draw the opening game prior to taking game actions in order to introduce sideboard cards for the match. If the players have completed game actions, it’s reasonable for them to use that knowledge to sideboard effectively. Note that this applies to the first game of the match, or to any match that begins on a second or subsequent game due to penalties assessed to one or more players prior to the first game beginning. This includes games started by the third activated ability of Karn Liberated; treat these restarted games as the same game in the match."></annotation>
            <point text="2. Players shuffle their decks. Steps 1 and 2 may be repeated."></point>
            <annotation text="Each player must present a fully randomized deck for each game — a player may not know the specific or general location of any face in the deck. “Pile shuffling,” or laying cards out in a determined number of stacks, is not considered sufficient for this process (MTR 3.9). Shuffling the deck is not a signal that all sideboarding is completed. Players may shuffle and reconsider their sideboard choices, so long as this is done in a reasonable time frame."></annotation>
            <point text="3. Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling. The sideboard (if any) is also presented at this time."></point>
            <annotation text="This clause is to prevent players from stacking their own decks through sleight-of-hand tactics in the shuffling process. Players should also allow their opponent to verify the legality of the sideboard for each game (the number of cards but not the contents). Once a player has presented their deck and the opponent has shuffled it, the time for repeating steps 1-2 has passed."></annotation>
            <point text="4. The appropriate player must decide whether to play first or second at this point, if they haven’t done so already (see section 2.2)."></point>
            <annotation text="This is covered in MTR 2.2 as well, but to recap: players decide if they want to play or draw before looking at their hand, as that could influence them greatly. Most people want to play first anyway, so we just default to that if they don’t explicitly announce it."></annotation>
            <point text="5. Each player draws seven cards. Optionally, these cards may be dealt face down on the table."></point>
            <annotation text="This rule defines the starting hand size for sanctioned tournament play. The method of drawing these cards is inconsequential as long as far as exactly seven cards are drawn. Dealing the cards face down on the table does not mean they are drawn. Many players do this to count out the cards to make sure they get the correct number."></annotation>
            <point text="6. Each player, in turn order, may take mulligans. (Rules on mulligans can be found in the Magic Comprehensive Rules, rule 103.4). If a player takes a mulligan, they shuffle again and repeat the presentation process described above."></point>
            <annotation text="Once a player has announced a decision to keep a starting hand, they may not later decide to take a mulligan based on the opponent’s decision. When a player announces a mulligan decision, they is held to that choice, even if it is made out of order. Note that steps 1-2 are not repeated during mulliganing. Cards may not be added or removed from the deck at this time. CR rule 103.4 will change to allow any player who took a mulligan to Scry after deciding to keep. For all of the technical details in how to proceed with mulliganing, check the Comprehensive Rules, rule 103.4."></annotation>
            <point text="The game is considered to have begun once all players have completed taking mulligans. Pregame procedures may be performed before time for the match has officially begun."></point>
            <annotation text="This rewards punctual players, who may be able to capture the full round time for game play, while still allowing a firm line of what can be done before the start of the round is announced."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="2.4 Conceding or Intentionally Drawing Games or Matches">
            <point text="If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match."></point>
            <annotation text="While the note on concession is generally obvious because players cannot be held in the tournament venue against their will, players are afforded the opportunity to intentionally draw to prevent intentional slow play and other undesirable outcomes that could negatively affect a tournament as a whole. If players were not allowed to intentionally draw, but a draw would still benefit both players, we would be encouraging players to “intentionally unintentionally draw” by slow playing —or worse— by playing at a reasonable pace but deciding to never attack and eventually just stall the game out, which just wastes everyone’s time."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players can also agree to draw only a specific game, which must be accurately reported to the Scorekeeper (e.g., 2-1-1) for tiebreaker purposes."></annotation>
            <point text="A match is considered complete once the result slip is filled out or, if match slips are not being used, a player leaves the table after game play is finished."></point>
            <annotation text="This rule is here to prevent players from needing to be precise in how they determine a winner. If a player has defeated, or is about to defeat their opponent they may still concede as long as the slip has not been filled out or turned in. This allows players to concede at any time without committing tournament fraud."></annotation>
            <point text="Until that point, either player may concede to or draw with the other, though if the conceding player won a game in the match, the match must be reported as 2-1. Intentional draws where no games were played are always reported as 0-0-3 or by using the “draw” button (0-0) in Wizards Event Reporter (WER)."></point>
            <annotation text="All games actually played must be recorded accurately, as some tournament tiebreakers are dependent on games won and lost. The note for intentional draws codifies and standardizes the scorekeeping practice."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be considered Bribery (see section 5.2)."></point>
            <annotation text="Ignorance of this rule is not a defense for having committed it, and doing so carries a penalty of Disqualification (see IPG 4.4: Bribery and Wagering). A player who is offered any reward or incentive must alert a judge immediately."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match."></point>
            <annotation text="But it helps everyone out if that player remembers to check the “drop” box on their match slip from the previous round. A player being present but refusing to play for some reason falls under this, though this is exceptionally rare."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="2.5 End-of-Match Procedure">
            <point text="If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn and five additional turns are played in total."></point>
            <annotation text="This “overtime” procedure is in place to allow all matches a chance to come to a natural conclusion and prevent one player from “milking the clock” and forcing a draw. While these additional turns are technically untimed, players are still expected to play at a reasonable pace, and are liable for slow play penalties."></annotation>
            <point text="This usually means that one player takes three turns and the other two, but a player taking extra turns may affect this."></point>
            <annotation text="There will only be five turns in the additional turn portion of the round. (But see IPG 3.3 — Slow Play, where two additional turns are added as an additional remedy.) Game circumstances (e.g., the activation of Ral Zarek’s third ability) may result in one player being entitled to all five turns. For more details on extra turns, see CR 500.7."></annotation>
            <point text="If the active player has already indicated that they’d like to pass the turn when the time limit is reached, that is considered to be in the next turn."></point>
            <point text="Team tournaments featuring multiple players playing together (such as Two-Headed Giant) use three turns instead of five."></point>
            <annotation text="During end of round the active player typically receives 2 turns and the non active player three turns. As players take their turns simultaneously, 3 extra turns in Two-Headed Giant accomplishes this ideal."></annotation>
            <point text="Once time is called, no new games should begin."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are not entitled to start a new game to take advantage of their remaining additional turns once time has been called. The round score should be reported following the conclusion of the most recent completed game."></annotation>
            <point text="If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw."></point>
            <annotation text="Players may discuss and come to an agreement on an alternate outcome for the game/match (e.g. a concession) so long as there is no incentive offered for the result (see IPG 4.4: Bribery and Wagering). Players may not utilize out-of-game assets, including but not limited to rolling a die, revealing cards off the top of the library, or the results of adjacent matches, to come to this decision (see IPG 4.3: Improperly Determining a Winner). Players must decide in a reasonable time frame, as it is unfair to make other players wait on this individual match debating who would have won seven turns from now. If players cannot come to an agreement, the match is still a draw and Judges are encouraged to “nudge” players to fill out their results slips, without influencing the decision."></annotation>
            <point text="If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason) the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are entitled to use the full time of a round to play their match of Magic. Should some interruption occur, time extensions are awarded to allow players a chance to fully play out their games. Players with a time extension who are still in a game when time is called should call a judge to ensure time continues to be kept accurately."></annotation>
            <point text="In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw."></point>
            <annotation text="There are some instances where the single-elimination portion of a tournament requires timed rounds (e.g., a venue closing or other curfew). Often this will be the case with single elimination Last Chance Trials at a Grand Prix. This necessitates the declaration of a winner despite a game or match not coming to a natural conclusion."></annotation>
            <point text="If all players have equal game wins at the end of additional turns, the player with the highest life total wins the current game. In the event all players have equal life totals (or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match continues with an additional statebased action: if a player does not have the highest life total, they lose the game. Two-Headed Giant teams are treated as a single player for determining a game winner."></point>
            <annotation text="This is the “Sudden Death” rule. Life totals are used because things like board state position and the like cannot be objectively judged, and can be dependent on cards in hand and library manipulation. As such, the most common win condition, the life total, is used as the ultimate tiebreaker to the unfortunate detriment of decks that utilize alternate win conditions (poison, milling, etc.)."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="2.6 Time Extensions">
            <point text="If a judge pauses a match for more than one minute while the round clock is running, they should extend the match time appropriately."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are entitled to use the full time of a round to play their match of Magic. Should some interruption come, time extensions are used to allow players a chance to fully play out their games. Players with a time extension who are still in a game when time is called should call a judge to ensure time continues to be kept accurately."></annotation>
            <point text="If the match was interrupted to perform a deck check, players are awarded time equal to the time the deck check took plus three minutes."></point>
            <annotation text="Because a deck check typically orders the deck in an intentionally non-random way, players should be afforded adequate time to randomize their decks before proceeding with the next game. While no longer codified, the benchmark for pre-game and between-game procedures is three minutes, so this much time is afforded to each player."></annotation>
            <point text="Feature matches at a tournament with online coverage receive a time extension equal to three minutes plus time elapsed in the round when players reach their table. This is not necessary if feature matches are being timed separately."></point>
            <annotation text="Players who are on coverage are doing so at the request of the organizer. We do not want to put players at a disadvantage because they simply have an interesting match to watch, and are doing the TO a favor. Of course, if the feature matches are timed separately we do not have to worry about the players being at a time disadvantage!"></annotation>
            <point text="Certain slow play penalties add turns rather than a time extension. These additional turns are added to the end-ofmatch additional turns."></point>
            <annotation text="For more information, see IPG 3.3: Slow Play. If a player receives a warning for slow play, each player is awarded an additional turn, totaling seven additional turns if one player is warned and nine additional turns if both players are warned. Note that no additional turns are awarded if slow play is penalized during the additional turns procedure. This is chosen as a way to give back some of the time that was lost, without having to try and quantify how much time was lost."></annotation>

        <point text="2.7 Deck Registration">
            <point text="Players are required to register their decks and sideboards (if applicable) in Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments. The Head Judge may require registration in Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments."></point>
            <annotation text="If a judge or Tournament Organizer wants to have decklists at Regular Rules Enforcement Level, they should make sure they inform the players as early as possible. If a judge or Tournament Organizer decides the event is serious enough to warrant decklists at Regular Rules Enforcement Level, however, they may want to instead change the Rules Enforcement Level to Competitive. Regular Rules Enforcement Level events with decklists are very rare."></annotation>
            <point text="Registered decklists record the original composition of each deck and sideboard (if applicable). Once your decklist has been accepted by a Tournament Official it may not be altered."></point>
            <annotation text="Altering a decklist after it has been accepted by a Tournament Official is not allowed because players might gain additional strategic information by waiting for a friend to help them decide what to play or by scouting opponents. A judge is allowed to alter the decklist when applying the fix for a Decklist Problem."></annotation>
            <point text="In Constructed tournaments, decklists must be submitted to a tournament official prior to the start of round 1, even if the player has an awarded bye for that round."></point>
            <point text="In Limited tournaments, decklists must be submitted prior to the start of the first round in which that player participates and does not have an awarded bye."></point>
            <annotation text="Constructed decklists need to be turned in before round 1 begins. Limited needs to be turned in before the first round the player is actually playing in begins. The difference here is that deck selection in constructed can vary much more based on scouting, and Sealed events typically require the deck to be built on site. This is going to be very rare outside of Grand Prix events where a large number of players will have byes for 1,2, or 3 rounds."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This rule is essentially what allows the sleep in special to exist! We may allow players to show up to limited Grand Prix events approximately the round before they are scheduled to play in order to construct their deck with plenty of time remaining. With Constructed events, they can easily turn in the list the night before."></annotation>
            <point text="Players have the right to request to see their decklist between matches. Such a request will be honored if logistically possible."></point>
            <annotation text="What is logistically possible is up to the judges at an event. Some event have thousands of decklists collected around the same time and trying to find one before they are organized might not be possible. If a player has alerted a judge to an error before they could gain advantage or before the event has begun, please be mindful of this information if unable to provide their list. Additionally, players will now often take a picture of their decklist once they have requested it, for their future use."></annotation>
            <point text="Generally, decklists are not public information and are not shared with other players during a tournament. At Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments (World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, and Grand Prix), copies of opponents’ decklists will be provided to players in the single-elimination playoffs."></point>
            <annotation text="In the single-elimination playoffs of limited events, the chances of your opponent gaining information about your decklist are a lot smaller. As such, we only provide decklists for constructed-format events. Star City Games Open Series have also allowed Top 8 players to view the opponents decklists."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that while they have the decklist, it is considered to be notes taken outside of the game so players may only view them while in between games."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="2.8 Deck Checks">
            <point text="Deck checks must be performed at all Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments, and the Head Judge has the option to perform deck checks at Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments. At least ten percent of all decks should be checked over the course of the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Note that this is a recommendation. Even though deck checks are very important, the tournament always has priority. Floor coverage should take priority over checking decks. Deck checks are a way to attempt to foil certain forms of cheating. The biggest factor is that they act as a deterrent, discouraging players from doing anything dishonest with their deck, since deck checks are going on."></annotation>
            <point text="A full deck check should not be performed if a player has drawn an opening hand and potentially made mulligan decisions."></point>
            <annotation text="Please note that this is a change! While in the past it was simply recommended that a check not be done once a player has drawn their hand, now it is stated that no full check should be performed. Realistically, unless there is some greater reason for those particular players, it is better to simply choose a different match to deck check."></annotation>

        <point text="2.9 Apelaciones al Juez Principal">
            <point text="If a player disagrees with a judge’s ruling, they may appeal the ruling to the Head Judge."></point>
            <annotation text="The right to appeal is one of the protections granted to players. It allows them to get a second opinion if they disagree on the Floor Judge’s ruling, or just think the penalty is too harsh."></annotation>
            <point text="In larger, Premier-level tournaments (such as Grand Prix, Players Tour, and Players Tour Finals), with prior approval, the Head Judge may designate additional Appeals Judges who are also empowered to hear appeals. They will be wearing the same uniform as the Head Judge."></point>
            <point text="Players may not appeal before the full ruling is made by the responding floor judge. Rulings made by the Head Judge or designated Appeals Judges are final."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are required to be respectful to judges, which includes letting them finish their ruling before disagreeing with them. Players appealing a judge based on perception of the Judge or how they think the judge is going to rule undermines that judge’s authority, and can be considered Unsporting Conduct — Minor."></annotation>

        <point text="2.10 Dropping from a Tournament">
            <point text="Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If a player drops from a tournament before the first round of play has started, they are considered to have not participated in the tournament and will not be listed in the finish order."></point>
            <annotation text="They are also not considered to have contributed to the attendance total for the event. This can matter for additional prize support at events like Magic Fest, and for records set at that event."></annotation>
            <point text="Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform the Scorekeeper by the means provided for that tournament before the pairings for the next round are generated."></point>
            <annotation text="Especially at larger events, there is a flurry of activity once pairings are generated since getting players playing quickly makes everyone happy. If a player tries to drop while pairing are being posted, they are already paired for the round."></annotation>
            <point text="Players wanting to drop after the Scorekeeper begins pairing for the next round will be paired for that round."></point>
            <annotation text="The other alternative would be to withdraw all pairings that were posted, do a repair, repost everything, and make several announcements to try to avoid confusion among those who saw the first set of pairings. Overall this could add noticeable delay to the event."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player does not show up for their match, they will be automatically dropped from the tournament unless they report to the Scorekeeper. Players that repeatedly and/or intentionally drop from tournaments without informing the scorekeepers of those tournaments may be the subject of penalties up to and including suspension."></point>
            <annotation text="Players who frequently drop and don’t inform anyone are bad for the community, as they force someone to sit around for 10 minutes doing nothing, and then for another 40 minutes also not playing Magic. It primarily affects lower tables, who are there at that point just to play Magic, not to win anything."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The suspension line details the fact that Wizards of the Coast can suspend players, not that they necessarily have."></annotation>
            <point text="Players who drop during limited tournaments own the cards that they correctly have in their possession at that time. This includes any unopened or partially drafted boosters."></point>
            <annotation text="This was clarified for Grand Prix Vegas in 2013. Players can take what they have in their hands and go home. This used to primarily cover players who wanted to drop before passing packs for value, but with the new registration procedure, players open the packs they will use, then have another player register. Players can still drop during this portion if there are time constraints/etc, and they get the boosters they originally were handed."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player drops from a tournament after a cut has been made, such as a cut to the top 8 playoff in a Grand Prix tournament, no other player is advanced as a replacement. The highest ranked remaining player receives a bye for the round instead."></point>
            <annotation text="It is rare for a player to voluntarily drop after a cut has been made, but emergencies do happen. However, sometimes a player is dropped involuntarily due to a disqualification. If that occurs, judges should not advance any other players into the Top X."></annotation>
            <point text="Players who have dropped may reenter a tournament at the discretion of the Head Judge. Players may not reenter a portion of the tournament that requires a deck built during a construction period that the player missed. Players may not reenter a tournament after any cut has been made."></point>
            <annotation text="When considering whether or not to reenter a player in the event, the Head Judge should look at how disruptive that it would be to the event as a whole."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players may not enter into a portion of the event that requires a draft or sealed deck as they would not have a legal deck with which to play their matches."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive. Doing so is considered Bribery (see section 5.2)."></point>

        <point text="2.11 Taking Notes">
            <point text="Players are allowed to take written notes during a match and may refer to those notes while that match is in progress. At the beginning of a match, each player’s note sheet must be empty and must remain visible throughout the match."></point>
            <annotation text="This rule allows players to write down their opponent’s hand while resolving Thoughtseize. Players can take any kind of notes during their match, and they are allowed to check those notes anytime in the current round."></annotation>
            <point text="Players do not have to explain or reveal notes to other players. Judges may ask to see a player’s notes and/or request that the player explain their notes."></point>
            <annotation text="Since a lot of Magic events are multinational ones, players are allowed to take notes in any language they want, even in Klingon. Since those notes are only for a player’s personal use, players are not obligated to explain or translate them to their opponent. A judge may ask a player to explain what is on their notes since it is vital for the judge’s job."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not refer to other notes, including notes from previous matches, during games."></point>
            <annotation text="While each game in the match is in progress, players are allowed only to look out into notes that they made during the current match. Players cannot check notes from previous rounds or notes that were created before event."></annotation>
            <point text="Between games, players may refer to a brief set of notes made before the match. They are not required to reveal these notes to their opponents. These notes must be removed from the play area before the beginning of the next game."></point>
            <annotation text="Players may consult notes made outside the match in between games. This is most often used for notes on how to sideboard, which are perfectly fine. If a players are provided their opponent’s deck list, such as during the Top 8 of particular Constructed events (MTR 2.7), this is also the time they may look at them."></annotation>
            <point text="Excessive quantities of notes (more than a sheet or two) are not allowed and may be penalized as slow play."></point>
            <annotation text="Since browsing through notes can take a while, players are not allowed to have very many. While a sheet or two is perfectly fine, a player can’t go through a novel. Players should be able to find and read relevant sections of notes in a reasonable amount of time."></annotation>
            <point text="The use of electronic devices to take and refer to notes is permitted at Regular Rules Enforcement Level (see section 2.12)."></point>
            <annotation text="But not at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level. The bulk of information is in Section 2.12, this is just specifically relaxing what is allowed at Regular Rules Enforcement Level."></annotation>
            <point text="Players and spectators (exception: authorized press) may not make notes while drafting."></point>
            <annotation text="Taking notes while drafting would add a lot of time to an event, and would have serious strategic impact on the game. Since spectators in a draft may be friends with players, they are not allowed to take notes either, and sometimes for Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level, spectators aren’t even allowed to watch closely."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not reference any outside notes during drafting, face pool registration, or deck construction."></point>
            <annotation text="Rules in this section apply also to other parts of the tournament outside of matches, especially drafting and deckbuilding. In competitive Rules Enforcement Level tournaments we are challenging players’ ability to create the best limited deck they can through face evaluation and deck construction, not just following a flowchart of what cards are best for different archetypes."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may refer to Oracle text at any time. They must do so publicly and in a format which contains no other strategic information."></point>
            <annotation text="Oracle text is considered the text written on the face. Since there have been a lot of wording changes or even functional changes for a lot of older cards, Oracle is available for everyone. Players can have printed Oracle text for cards as long as there is no other information on those papers and it’s not reached via forbidden electronic devices."></annotation>
            <point text=" Consulting online sources, such as gatherer.wizards.com, is allowed at Regular Rules Enforcement Level even if they contain a small amount of strategic information. If a player wishes to view Oracle text in private, they must ask a judge."></point>
            <annotation text="At Regular Rules Enforcement Level events players can access Oracle by themselves, yet you need to show what they are doing to the opponent as well. Of course players are always allowed to ask a judge for current Oracle text in private as long as they are able to identify the face they are looking for, either by name, or by description."></annotation>
            <point text="Artistic modifications to cards that indirectly provide minor strategic information are acceptable."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are allowed to have minor face alterations that don’t directly provide them with substantial strategic advice, but has some minor information.

        <point text="2.12 Electronic Devices.">
            <point text="At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level during drafting, deck construction, and playing of matches, players may not use electronic devices capable of taking and storing notes, communicating with other people, or accessing the internet (except for taking brief personal calls with the opponent's permission)."></point>
            <annotation text="With advances in technology, we can’t check what is and what is not on players’ phones. Since it is possible to exchange information with everyone instantly through electronic devices, there was only one solution: ban any kind of electronic devices that can communicate with anything else at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level events. And so players are not allowed to use those kind of devices at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level events."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The previous incarnation of this rule banned all electronic devices, but was relaxed to only those that are capable of taking and storing notes, communicating with others, or accessing the internet. This allows dumb calculators as life keepers, people can have pace makers, Brian Kibler can sit and listen to music while shuffling, etc."></annotation>
            <point text="At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, electronic devices are permitted, but players may not use them to access information that contains substantial strategic advice or information about an opponent's deck."></point>
            <annotation text="Regular Rules Enforcement Level has an exception since it’s a more relaxed atmosphere, and many players use things like their cell phones to keep track of life. Players are still not allowed to access any kind of forbidden materials (like strategy articles) through their devices."></annotation>
            <point text="Device use during a match other than brief personal calls must be visible to all players. Players wishing to view information privately on electronic devices during matches must request permission from a judge."></point>
            <annotation text="That first part of this paragraph applies only for Regular Rules Enforcement Level. If a player is tracking life totals on their mobile phone, they should make sure it’s visible for every player as well. Any kind of usage devices in private should be made after receiving permission from a judge."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge or Tournament Organizer of a tournament may further restrict or forbid the use of electronic devices during matches."></point>

        <point text="2.13 Video Coverage">
            <point text="Some Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments use video for live streaming or replay broadcast of matches. Players may decline to appear on camera; however, players in the playoff matches of Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments may not decline to appear on camera."></point>
            <annotation text="Typically every player fills out a press release form at larger events with video coverage. Players can refuse for reasons from being shy to being in witness protection, but all Top 8 matches are on coverage."></annotation>
            <point text=" Video commentators are considered spectators for the purpose of the tournament but may talk during the match as long as they can’t be heard by players being covered. They are responsible for behaving respectfully to all tournament participants during coverage."></point>
            <annotation text="At Grand Prix, the coverage team is usually 25m (75 ft) away from the feature match area so that players can’t overhear the coverage team talking about cards that were just drawn, or lines of play available to players."></annotation>
            <point text="Spectators are also permitted to record matches provided that they do so unobtrusively."></point>
            <annotation text="Spectators can’t share those notes with a player during play. Doing so is probably going to be Outside Assistance."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge of a World Championship, Players Tour, or Players Tour Finals, or Magic Tabletop Mythic Championship tournament may, in their sole discretion, use video replay to assist in making rulings during a match. Video replays may not be used to assist in making rulings in tournaments other than a World Championship, Players Tour, or Players Tour Finals. Players may not request that a judge consult a video replay. Video replays may also be used for investigative purposes at a later time."></point>
            <annotation text="Most of this was added in August 2015. Video has always been fair game for the Investigations Committee to use post-event."></annotation>
            <annotation text="There’s a few reasons why coverage was previously unable to use video replay:"></annotation>
            <annotation text="• People on camera may get some additional advantage when they are on camera due to the video replay option."></annotation>
            <annotation text="• It adds time to the investigation. The Head Judge needs to head somewhere, have the video team find the video for that match, find the exact spot, and then watch it, possibly multiple times."></annotation>

Also, the player using the face may not realize that they are using fake cards, so aside from alerting them that they are using fake cards and informing them that they must replace them, we, as judges, should not take further action unless we believe they knew and were using such cards intentionally."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Also, Tournament Officials do not have the legal authority to confiscate fake cards and should not attempt to do so. Stopping their use in the event is sufficient."></annotation>
            <point text="• The face has a standard Magic back, is a double-faced face, or is a face that is part of a meld pair."></point>

            <point text="• The face does not have squared corners."></point>
            <annotation text="Collectors’ Edition cards have black borders on the face, but square corners and a gold border on the back. These are not legal for tournament use. Also, uncut sheets of cards are sometimes cut for use. It is important that these cards have the same corners as all other cards."></annotation>
            <point text="• Silver-bordered cards may only be used in casual events and only when the format explicitly permits them."></point>
			<annotation text="Cards from Unglued, Unhinged, and Unstable all have silver borders with a standard Magic back. These are only legal to play in their specific formats. Gold bordered cards also exist, though they do not have a standard Magic back."></annotation>
			<point text="• The face is not a token face."></point>
            <annotation text="Tokens are used to represent objects that don’t exist as normal Magic cards. While some official tokens exist, it is not required that they be used during tournament play."></annotation>
            <point text="• The face is not damaged or modified in a way that might make it marked."></point>
            <annotation text="Significantly creased cards can be distinguished from other cards in a deck, even sleeved. Also, altered cards may be thicker than the other cards in the deck, depending on the method used to alter the face. If any cards can be distinguished from the other cards in the deck without viewing its front face, then those cards are marked and not legal for tournament play."></annotation>
            <point text="• The face is otherwise legal for the tournament as defined by the format."></point>
            <annotation text="The cards being played in the deck must be printed in a set that is legal in the format, even if the printing being used is from an otherwise illegal set. For example, it is okay to use the Stronghold printing of Mana Leak in Modern even though Stronghold is not a legal set for use in Modern."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge of a tournament may issue a proxy (see section 3.4) for a face that has become worn or damaged during the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Further discussion of proxies may be found in MTR section 3.4, but it is important to note that a proxy may only be issued by the Head Judge of an event, and should only be issued for cards that are damaged during the course of the tournament, or from damaged or misprinted Limited product. The original, damaged face must be kept near the play area and will replace the proxy whenever that face is on the stack or the battlefield."></annotation>
            <point text="Any other cards that are not Authorized Game Cards are prohibited in all sanctioned tournaments."></point>
            <annotation text="Any face that does not meet the above criteria, including homemade proxies, may not be used in a tournament that is sanctioned by a WPN store. While some events exist that allow proxies (usually for Vintage, Legacy and Commander events), those events must not be run as a sanctioned event with WER reporting software."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may use cards from the Alpha printing only if the deck is in opaque sleeves."></point>
            <annotation text="Cards from the Alpha printing have corners that are significantly more rounded than all cards from the Beta printing onward. They are easily distinguished from any other face in the deck if the sleeves can be seen through."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may use otherwise-legal non-English and/or misprinted cards provided they are not using them to create an advantage by using misleading text or pictures. Official promotional textless spells are allowed in sanctioned Magic tournaments in which they would otherwise be legal."></point>
            <annotation text="It is not required that players play with cards that are printed in the native language of the area in which the tournament is being run. If a player needs to know what a face does, either because it is in a language they cannot read, or it is a textless printing, they may call for a judge and ask for the Oracle text."></annotation>
            <annotation text="There are some famous misprints whose art is from a different face. For example, the German-language printing of Revised had a Forest (Wald) with Plains art. These cards, while an interesting curiosity, create an ambiguous and confusing game state and should not be used in tournament play."></annotation>
            <point text="Artistic modifications are acceptable in sanctioned tournaments, provided that the modifications do not make the face art unrecognizable, contain substantial strategic advice, or contain offensive images. Artistic modifications also may not cover or change the mana cost or name of the face."></point>
            <annotation text="While the Head Judge of an event may decide to allow or disallow any given altered face, it is important to keep the above guidelines in mind. If the art is still recognizable, the name and mana cost are not obstructed, and the face is not distinguishable from any other face in the deck while in a hidden zone, then it should be allowed. The potential offensiveness of an alter is a more subjective area and should likely have a more conservative approach."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge is the final authority on acceptable cards for a tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="To ensure consistency within any given tournament, the Head Judge is the sole arbiter of the legality of a face. It is good practice for players using altered cards to get approval from the Head Judge prior to the start of the tournament."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player is required to replace a face in their deck and is unable to find a replacement, the player may replace the face with a face named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest of their choice. This also applies to cards that are lost and must be replaced to have a legal deck."></point>
            <annotation text="Never issue proxies for marked cards, unless it is a Limited format event and the cards were opened marked. Foils in humid environments are sometimes marked fresh out of the package. Note that lost sideboard cards are not required to be replaced with lands. The player may revert back to the original configuration if acceptable replacements are found later in the event. Please note that wastes and snow covered lands are not acceptable replacement lands!"></annotation>

        <point text="3.4 Proxy Cards">
            <point text="A proxy face is used during competition to represent an otherwise legal Magic face or checklist face that can no longer be included in a deck without the deck being marked. For a proxy to be issued, the face it is replacing must meet at least one of the following criteria:"></point>
            <point text="• The face has been accidentally damaged or excessively worn in the current tournament, including damaged or misprinted Limited product. Proxies are not allowed as substitutes for cards that their owner has damaged intentionally or through negligence."></point>
            <point text="• The face is a foil face for which no non-foil printing exists."></point>
            <annotation text="We want to issue proxies only in cases where the face or cards have been damaged through no fault of the player or they do not exist as a non-foil variant (“Kess, Dissident Mage” for example). Cards being expensive or rare are not reasons to issue a proxy. Also, while purchasing well-worn or damaged cards will save money, if the cards are distinguishable from others in the deck, they cannot be played and no proxy will be issued."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not create their own proxies; they may only be created by the Head Judge who has sole discretion as to whether the creation of a proxy is appropriate. When a judge creates a proxy, it is included in the player’s deck and must be denoted as a proxy in a clear and conspicuous manner. The original face is kept nearby during the match and replaces the proxy while in a public zone as long as it is recognizable. A proxy is valid only for the duration of the tournament in which it was originally issued."></point>
            <annotation text="Using a sharpie on a basic land is a simple and effective way to issue a proxy. It is recommended to initial the proxy as well so that the judge staff and other players in the event can recognize that the proxy was properly issued. Include the name of the face, and its mana cost on the proxy. Any other information may be added at the Head Judge’s discretion."></annotation>

        <point text="3.5 Checklist Cards">
            <point text="Official checklist cards are used to represent double-faced cards in the sets that contain them. Only official checklist cards may be used to represent double-faced cards in a deck."></point>
            <annotation text="It is a player’s responsibility to have checklist cards or appropriate sleeves. A judge should not create proxies to represent checklist cards unless the original face has become damaged during the current tournament."></annotation>
            <point text="The use of checklist cards is required if a player has double-faced cards in their deck and is not using completely opaque sleeves."></point>
            <annotation text="The easiest way to check for a sleeves opaqueness is to look for the white mana symbol on the back of a non-double-faced face."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player uses a checklist face to represent a double-faced face in their deck, then all copies of that double-faced face in the deck must be represented by checklist cards, and any copies of that double-faced face in a hidden zone are considered to not exist for purposes of determining deck legality."></point>
            <annotation text="If a player accidentally shuffles their double-faced face into their deck with checklist cards, we treat them the same way we would a token shuffled in and remove them without issuing an infraction. Note that this also means you may not mix and match. If a player has Archangel Avacyn checklist cards in their deck, then they may also have Duskwatch Recruiter cards."></annotation>
            <point text="Each individual checklist face used must have one (and only one) of the items checked."></point>
            <annotation text="Some players will black out all of the boxes except for the face they are representing. Any way of marking the checklist face that makes the face unambiguous is acceptable."></annotation>
            <point text="A checklist face is only used while the face it represents is in a hidden zone. The face represented by a checklist face is not a playable Magic face until the checklist face has been placed in a public zone. Multiple checklists cannot be used to represent a single copy of the actual face. For each checklist face used, the player must have a copy of the actual face available, though they are not considered sideboard cards and are not presented to their opponent."></point>
            <annotation text="When the face is on the battlefield, the real face should be placed over the checklist face. Checking to make sure a player has the proper number of double-faced cards for the number of checklists in their deck is very important during deck checks."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="3.6 Card Identification and Interpretation">
            <point text="A face is considered named in game when a player has provided a description (which may include the name or partial name) that could only apply to one face. Any player or judge realizing a description is still ambiguous must seek further clarification."></point>
            <annotation text="Anytime a player names a face, it needs to be done in a way so everyone is aware of what face they are naming. If anyone believes they have not done so, they need to ask for further clarification"></annotation>
            <point text="Players have the right to request access to the official wording of a face they can describe. That request will be honored if logistically possible."></point>
            <annotation text="The fact that most face-searching apps include Oracle text is made very relevant by this bit. Players will often request oracle text for cards they or their opponents are using in tournaments, and judges should be prepared to provide it. Several phone apps include complete, downloaded, searchable databases of every single face’s Oracle text, and these are by far the easiest way to quickly find and display it. As a general rule, if you can punch the info they give you into the search function and find a precise face, they’ve described it well enough. Saying “the green three drop that people play a lot in standard” or “The one-drop red burn spell” isn’t uniquely identifying a face, but saying “The white planeswalker from Magic: Origins” or “The take an extra turn face with Delve” is. If a face is revealed to a player, they do not need to know anything about the face to request Oracle text for it."></annotation>
            <point text="The official text of any face is the Oracle text corresponding to the name of the face."></point>
            <annotation text="Regardless of what the text on the face says, any sanctioned event must use the current Oracle text for each face, which can be found on Gatherer or pretty much on any phone app that you can search for cards on. If we didn’t use Oracle text, several old cards wouldn’t work with the game’s rules, several cards would be missing important errata, and the Portuguese printing for Stoic Rebuttal wouldn’t actually do anything."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not use errors or omissions in Oracle to abuse the rules. The Head Judge is the final authority for face interpretations, and they may overrule Oracle if an error is discovered."></point>
            <annotation text="This may look like a clause that’s included just in case a face has a typo, but there have been cases where a Head Judge has overruled an oracle to prevent abuse. Wizards of the Coast is much more careful about the cards they print and the errata they make these days, but there have been high profile cases of a Head Judge overruling Oracle, notably the 1999 French Nationals and the Oracle text for Yawgmoth’s Will."></annotation>

        <point text="3.7 New Releases">
            <point text="Newly released face sets become tournament legal for sanctioned, rated tournaments on the following dates:"></point>
            <point text="• Core Set 2021 - July 3, 2020"></point>
			<point text="• Jumpstart - July 17, 2020 (Eternal Formats Only)"></point>
            <annotation text="Cards from Prerelease tournaments, spoiler cards, and cards stolen from Wizards of the Coast headquarters in grand heists are not legal for use in tournaments until the set they are from is officially released. This list is constantly updating, and we’d be surprised if the MTR is the first place you go to look for these dates."></annotation>
            <point text="For official Prerelease tournaments only, new sets are legal for use before the official format legal date. In these cases, any announced rules updates shall be in effect at these tournaments, including informal explanations of new rules and mechanics. Judges may apply additional rules that they believe will be updated."></point>
            <annotation text="This is the one obvious exception. Prerelease tournaments are treated as though the set was already released. Any changes to the rule, whether big or small, are in effect at the Prerelease tournament even though they aren’t officially brought into effect until the release of the set."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Judges applying rules they believe will be updated should be incredibly obvious rules additions, such as allowing masterpieces to be played without a legal magic border."></annotation>
            <point text="These dates may be subject to change. Any changes will be announced at:"></point>

        <point text="3.8 Game Markers">
            <point text="Small items (e.g. glass beads) may be used as markers and placed on top of a player’s own library or graveyard as a reminder for in-game effects. These markers may not disguise the number of cards remaining in that zone nor completely obscure any face."></point>
            <annotation text="Players will often put something on top of their deck in order to remind them of an upkeep trigger, such as rebound, and occasionally players will put something on top of their graveyard in order to remind them of some continuous effect. “Small” is very subjective, and there are stories of a player using a plastic fishbowl to completely cover their own deck to prevent them from drawing a face before remembering the upkeep trigger. The key rules are that the item can’t obscure the cards, can’t make it difficult to see any revealed cards, and can’t be a face itself."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="3.9 Card Shuffling">
            <point text="Decks must be randomized at the start of every game and whenever an instruction requires it. Randomization is defined as bringing the deck to a state where no player can have any information regarding the order or position of cards in any portion of the deck."></point>
            <annotation text="The phrase “order or position” is key. A deck that is “mana-weaved” is not random; even though the player may have no information about the location of a specific face, they have information about the cards’ order (that is, land-spell-spell, land-spell-spell). Also key is that a player shouldn’t know any information on where a face is, not even which half of the deck it is in."></annotation>
            <point text="Pile shuffling may not be performed other than once each at the beginning of a game to count the cards in the deck."></point>
            <annotation text="Pile shuffling is completely non-random, since individual cards can be tracked and since cards are shuffled into a deterministic order. A single pile shuffle can help players count their decks and loosen sticky cards, but more than that a pile shuffle does not contribute to randomization and will qualify as Slow Play. Once the game has begun the need to count the deck during randomization is largely gone.  As such, a single pile shuffle at the start of the game is permitted, but is not allowed at any other time.  Please remember when applying the IPG that habits are hard to break, and a single caution may be appropriate the first time."></annotation>
            <point text="Once the deck is randomized, it must be presented to an opponent. By this action, players state that their decks are legal and randomized. The opponent may then shuffle it additionally. Cards and sleeves must not be in danger of being damaged during this process."></point>
            <annotation text="The deck should be fully randomized when presented to the opponent, and the opponents’ shuffles are not meant to make the deck “more random.” The purpose of the second shuffle is to discourage deck-stacking and cheating."></annotation>
            <point text=" If the opponent does not believe the player made a reasonable effort to randomize their deck, the opponent must notify a judge."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges still need to know what’s going on. Earlier versions of the IPG included an example under Cheating which outlawed “3 pile shuffling to undo a suspected mana-weave,” but this example was removed in the February 2015 update. While not calling a judge may no longer be cheating, judges should still be notified immediately."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may request to have a judge shuffle their cards rather than the opponent; this request will be honored only at a judge’s discretion."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges should use their discretion on this. Shuffling takes a significant amount of time, during which the judge can’t take other calls. Shuffling for players should be reserved for exceptional circumstances."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player has had the opportunity to see any of the face faces of the deck being shuffled, the deck is no longer considered randomized and must be randomized again."></point>
            <annotation text="At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level, a player who does not re-randomize their deck after seeing cards has committed Looking at Extra Cards and may need to be investigated for cheating."></annotation>
            <point text="At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments, players are required to shuffle their opponents’ decks after their owners have shuffled them. The Head Judge can require this at Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments as well."></point>
            <annotation text="In some cultures, asking to shuffle an opponent’s deck would be considered an insult. The requirement to shuffle an opponent’s deck is intended to prevent cheaters from taking advantage of these cultural norms."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Because a deck presented to an opponent should be random, this additional shuffle does not need to be thorough. However, simply cutting the deck is often not sufficient to meet this requirement."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="3.10 Sleeves">
            <point text="Players may use plastic face sleeves or other protective devices on cards."></point>
            <annotation text="Often players will be using face sleeves to protect their cards from the dirt and friction they would otherwise be exposed to through repeated usage. Provided that they do not interfere with shuffling, or could be considered offensive, they will be allowed with the following conditions."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player chooses to use face sleeves, all sleeves must be identical and all cards in their deck must be placed in the sleeves in an identical manner."></point>
            <annotation text="Having decks of mixed brands/types/colors/condition/size etc. of sleeves is a no go, as it allows players to tell their cards apart. Additionally the conditions of the sleeves should be noted. If most of the set is scuffed and worn on the visible side when in the deck, but a few sleeves are in notably better condition, the sleeves are not identical. Another common practice is to “double sleeve” a deck, in this case all cards must be double sleeved so there exist no variation in rigidity and thickness of cards in the deck. Notable deviations from the identical nature of the sleeves ought be considered Marked Cards."></annotation>
            <point text="If the sleeves feature holograms or other similar markings, cards must be inserted into the sleeves so these markings appear only on the faces of the cards."></point>
            <annotation text="So as to prevent information being revealed by reflecting the face of a face above in a stack all holograms and the like must be solely on the face of the face sleeve."></annotation>
            <point text="During a match, a player may request that a judge inspect an opponent’s face sleeves."></point>
            <annotation text="If a player finds something suspicious they may request a judge to check opponents sleeves for Marked Cards. The process for this is similar to that of a deck check, where the cards are briefly examined for dissimilarity or problems. It should be noted that all sleeves could be considered marked if examined closely enough, and this ought be considered when evaluating sleeves."></annotation>
            <point text="The judge may disallow the face sleeves if they believe they are marked, worn, or otherwise in a condition or of a design that interferes with shuffling or game play."></point>
            <annotation text="In the event that the face sleeves are determined to be interfering with game play or compromising the integrity of the game. The judge may require replacement sleeves to be used for the remainder of the tournament."></annotation>
            <point text="In the interest of efficiency, the judge may choose to delay any change of sleeves until the end of the match."></point>
            <annotation text="The act of requiring a player to change sleeves mid match is undeniably disruptive, if the judge feels that there is no urgent need, postponing the change of sleeves until after the match is a superior alternative. If necessary a time extension may be given to complete the task and allow the player to continue in the tournament."></annotation>
            <point text="Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments impose additional restrictions on sleeves."></point>
            <annotation text="Due to the nature of Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level events, additional restrictions are set in place to ensure that the integrity of the event is upheld. As such in these events the following observations and regulations ought be enforced and considered."></annotation>
            <point text="Highly reflective backs are not allowed. Sleeves with hologram patterns across some or all of the sleeve front or back are not allowed."></point>
            <annotation text="If a sleeve has a highly reflective backing, information may be gained when picking up cards from the deck where some characteristics could be observed such as whether or not the face is a land, or what color it is. This of course is not something that can be allowed due to the risk it creates."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The restriction on hologram patterns across the front is in effort to maximize clarity of the game as to not disrupt the viewing of the face for both players. It should be noted that due to the insignificant nature of something like the Ultra Pro logo sticker, its placement and size make it a non-factor when evaluating the sleeves."></annotation>
            <point text="Sleeves with artwork on their backs may be subjected to additional scrutiny, especially if there is no solid border around the edges."></point>
            <annotation text="With solid borders a player cannot easily hide marks on the sleeves that can be seen when the cards are in a stack, whereas without a solid border, abnormalities are far harder to notice, and thus demand extra study when evaluating the sleeves."></annotation>
            <point text="When using sleeves on double-faced cards, sleeves must be completely opaque."></point>
            <annotation text="In the event that a player is using double-faced cards with in their deck rather than a checklist face, the sleeve must not allow any indication that a double-faced face is within. Often the easiest way to observe this is by looking at the back of the sleeve in various angles in light to determine opaqueness. If the sleeves prove ineffective at preventing the nature of the double-faced face from being revealed the player will either need to use appropriate checklist cards, or use new, suitable sleeves. The infraction Marked Cards may also apply."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge is the final authority on what sleeves are allowed."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="3.11 Marked Cards">
            <point text="Players are responsible for ensuring that their cards and/or face sleeves are not marked during the tournament. A face or sleeve is considered marked if it bears something that makes it possible to identify the face without seeing its face, including (but not limited to) scratches, discoloration, and bends."></point>
            <annotation text="Cards must stand out when in the deck to be considered marked. If you have to bend the face and look at it from funny angles to get the light to hit it just right, it is not marked."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player’s cards are sleeved, the cards must be examined while in the sleeves to determine if they are marked. Players should use care when sleeving their decks and should randomize their decks prior to sleeving them to reduce the possibility of cards becoming marked with a pattern. Players should also keep in mind that cards or sleeves may become worn and potentially marked through play during a tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Many brands of sleeves will have inconsistencies in their coloring or cut. Players should shuffle the sleeves and cards prior to sleeving to prevent the inconsistencies from creating a pattern."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge has the authority to determine if a face in a player’s deck is marked. Judges may request that a player remove their current sleeves or replace any of the deck’s current sleeves immediately, or before the next round."></point>
            <annotation text="If the sleeves are marked enough that you are giving a Warning at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, instruct the player to replace them between rounds. If their round runs late, give them a reasonable time extension in the following round to facilitate re-sleeving. If the penalty is being upgraded to a Game Loss, the player needs to replace the sleeves immediately. Judges are often tasked with assisting the player to expedite the process. Make sure to follow-up with players after instructing them to replace sleeves to ensure that they have done so."></annotation>

            <point text="Communication between players is essential to the successful play of any game that involves virtual objects or hidden information. While bluffing may be an aspect of games, there need to be clear lines as to what is, and is not, acceptable for players to say or otherwise represent. This will confirm expectations of both sporting and competitive players during a game."></point>
            <annotation text="While players are willing to do whatever they can to win, judges need to make sure players behave within the rules. Bluffing is okay, for example, but we cannot condone any behavior that crosses the line into cheating or other unsportsmanlike conduct."></annotation>

            <point text="There are four categories of information: status, free, derived and private."></point>
            <point text="Status information is information that must be announced upon change and physically tracked by the affected player. Methods for tracking must be visible to both players during the match. A shared method is acceptable as long as all players in the match have access to it. At Competitive and Professional REL, methods that can easily be accidentally changed (such as dice) may not be used. Status information consists of:"></point>
            <point text="• Life totals."></point>
            <point text="• Counters a player has attached to them."></point>

			<point text="• Unspent mana in a player’s mana pool."></point>
            <annotation text="Example: If a player asks their opponent for their current life total, that player is required to respond truthfully and directly. Answers like, “You can figure it out” or “Twenty” when the player is actually at seventeen life are unacceptable."></annotation>
            <annotation text="These types of information need to be immediately pointed out when the change occurs."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A very common method of tracking life or counters on a player is with pencil/paper."></annotation>
            <point text="Free information is information to which all players are entitled access without contamination or omissions made by their opponents. If a player is ever unable or unwilling to provide free information to an opponent that has requested it, they should call a judge and explain the situation. Free information consists of:"></point>

            <point text="• The name of any visible object."></point>

            <point text="• The current step and/or phase and which player(s) are active."></point>
            <annotation text="A player always has to give all free information to their opponent accurately upon request. If that is not possible they should call a judge to help clear up the communication. If a player unintentionally misrepresents free information at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, it may result in a Communication Policy Violation."></annotation>
            <point text="Derived information is information to which all players are entitled access, but opponents are not obliged to assist in determining and may require some skill or calculation to determine. Derived information consists of:"></point>
            <point text="• The number of any kind of objects present in any game zone that are not defined as free information."></point>
            <point text="• All characteristics of objects in public zones that are not defined as free or status information."></point>
            <point text="• Game Rules, Tournament Policy, Oracle content and any other official information pertaining to the current tournament. Cards are considered to have their Oracle text printed on them."></point>
            <annotation text="While a player is not obliged to assist their opponent with the Game Rules, Tournament Policy, Oracle text, or any other official information pertaining to the current tournament, a player may ask a judge for any of that information during a match. For example, if a player asks their opponent what a face does, for example, a player does not have to give all of the information about the face. Their opponent may say that Vampire Nighthawk is a flying 2/3 creature and omit that it has Deathtouch and Lifelink."></annotation>
            <point text="Private information is information to which players have access only if they are able to determine it from the current visual game state or their own record of previous game actions."></point>

            <point text="• If a player notices a discrepancy in recorded or announced status information, they are expected to point it out as soon as the discrepancy is noticed."></point>
            <point text="• Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge completely and honestly, regardless of the type of information requested. Players may request to do so away from the match."></point>
            <point text="• Players may not represent derived, free, or status information incorrectly."></point>
            <point text="• Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free information."></point>

            <point text="Judges are encouraged to help players in determining free and status information but must avoid assisting players with derived information about the game state."></point>
            <annotation text="Players need to be honest with their opponents regarding free information and must be completely honest with judges, whether the judge asks about free or other information.

        <point text="4.2 Tournament Shortcuts">
            <point text="A tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the technical play sequence without explicitly announcing them. Tournament shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow players to play in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the rules."></point>
            <annotation text="Players naturally use shortcuts all the time to make the game to run smoothly and without unnecessary delays. Imagine if, every time a player casts a spell, they say, “I put it on the stack, choose these targets, tap a land for mana, pay the costs,” instead of simply tapping some lands, putting the face on the table and pointing to a target. Playing Magic Online with all possible yields and stops can give you a general idea of what that would be like."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Tournament shortcuts go a step further to improve the pace of games and to reduce the number of “gotcha” situations. While shortcuts exist to expedite gameplay, players still make mistakes and may accidentally use shortcuts to pass a point when they intended to take an action."></annotation>
            <point text="Most tournament shortcuts involve skipping one or more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players;"></point>
            <annotation text="These shortcuts make it easier for players to communicate even when there’s a language barrier involved. Thanks to shortcuts, players around the world can use simple phrases like “Go” and “Attacks?” to communicate. There’s almost no room for interpretation, leading to fewer “feel bad” moments for players."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player wishes to demonstrate or use a new tournament shortcut entailing any number of priority passes, they must be clear where the game state will end up as part of the request."></point>
            <annotation text="A player may suggest a new tournament shortcut by saying something like, “I do this, you do this, I do this and this is where we end up”. The shortcut is invalid if a player cannot demonstrate or describe the exact sequence that leads to the desired result."></annotation>
            <point text="A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how they are deviating from it or at which point in the middle they wish to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in this manner."></point>
            <annotation text="For example, Player A controls Basalt Monolith and Mesmeric Orb and says, “I’d like to tap and untap this Monolith 30 times or until I reveal a land.” This suggests a shortcut and a stopping point for interrupting the shortcut."></annotation>
            <point text="A player is not allowed to use a previously undeclared tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game."></point>
            <point text="A player may not request priority and take no action with it. If a player decides they do not wish to do anything, the request is nullified and priority is returned to the player that originally had it."></point>
            <annotation text="A player can’t ask, “Can I Lightning Bolt you now?”, receive priority, and then pass without acting in order to deprive their opponent of priority. They must either act or priority will be returned to the previous player."></annotation>
            <point text="During the resolution of one of their spells or abilities, a player may not assume their opponent has taken a shortcut. They must seek confirmation that a choice with no visible impact was taken."></point>
            <annotation text="A player must make sure an opponent has chosen not to use an optional effect from their spell or ability. If a player casts Path to Exile on the opponent’s Grizzly Bears, and the opponent does not search for a basic land, they must be told that the spell allows them to do so. (Failure to do so may be a CPV)."></annotation>
            <point text="Certain conventional tournament shortcuts used in Magic are detailed below."></point>
            <annotation text="These are Official tournament shortcuts that are universal across all sanctioned tournaments. Players are still free to propose other shortcuts during their games as long as they stick to the rules."></annotation>
            <point text="They define a default communication; if a player wishes to deviate from these, they should be explicit about doing so."></point>
            <annotation text="When a player wants to interrupt or change a shortcut, they must be explicit about it. When a player says, “Go,” and their opponent wants to act still in main phase, they must indicate the deviation. Otherwise, the action occurs at the moment defined by the shortcut (in this case in their opponent’s end step)."></annotation>
            <point text="Note that some of these are exceptions to the policy above in that they do cause non-explicit priority passes."></point>
            <point text="• If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their first main phase, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in beginning of combat"></point>
            <annotation text="If the active player says “Combat” or “Attacks?”, they are assumed to be passing priority. If the opponent does something in response, generally they want to be doing it in Beginning of Combat, right before attackers are declared. This is their last chance, and is when they will want to do it a large majority of the time, so we treat it as the default, with an exception."></annotation>
            <point text="unless they are affecting whether a beginning of combat ability triggers."></point>
            <annotation text="The main exception will be if there are cards that have “At the beginning of combat” triggers, such as Goblin Rabblemaster. Opponents will often want to kill the creature before the effect goes on the stack, so if they act in response it’s assumed it is in main phase, as that is when such actions will normally be taken."></annotation>
            <point text="Then, after those actions resolve or no actions took place, the active player receives priority at the beginning of combat."></point>
            <annotation text="This means that if the active player says “go to combat?”, they still have a chance to crew vehicles or activate creature lands if they want. However, the non-active player still has another chance to do something."></annotation>
            <point text="Beginning of combat triggered abilities (even ones that target) may be announced at this time."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence allows for more leniency in identifying whether a trigger was missed. It overrules the section in the IPG that states when players need to demonstrate awareness of triggered abilities. The IPG details that triggered abilities with targets need to have the targets announced before they pass priority, and with this shortcut we are blurring the lines for a couple of priority passes. This doesn’t mean the player can announce Beginning of Combat triggers whenever suits them, these triggers should still actually occur in Beginning of Combat."></annotation>
            <point text="• If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their second main phase or uses a phrase such as “Go” or “Your Turn” at any time, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in the end step unless they are affecting how or whether an end of turn ability triggers."></point>
            <annotation text="This is worded similar to the combat shortcut, with some differences. When ending the turn, most players just say “Go” or “I’m done”, or just gesture with their hand. This shortcut is in use when players attempt to pass the turn. If there is confusion about the communication, just ask both players separately what they thought was meant, and how passing has worked so far in the game, using your judgement after that. If the non-active player is casting spells, they typically mean to do so at the last opportunity in order to limit options to the active player. The exceptions to this would involve pre-empting triggered abilities that occur at the beginning of the end step. This means killing a Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur to prevent it from drawing a player cards, or killing multiple zombies in order to lessen the effect of Liliana, the Last Hope emblem would be assumed to happen in the post combat main phase."></annotation>
            <point text="End of turn triggered abilities that do not target resolve after the non-active player passes priority."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a noticeable difference to the combat shortcut, but it reflects that people handle these two steps differently. For end of turn triggered abilities with targets, the controlling player still needs to follow the guidelines to show awareness as listed in the IPG. This means for ones that target, it needs to be announced as the player goes into the phase. For the most part, we expect players to announce triggered abilities pretty quickly as they pass the turn. This line provides clarity that if there are actions taken at end of turn, the active player can still demonstrate awareness of triggered abilities like those that create a token."></annotation>
            <point text="• Whenever a player adds an object to the stack, they are assumed to be passing priority unless they explicitly announce that they intend to retain it."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a perfect example of how shortcuts speed up the game by matching how people naturally play it. Otherwise, players would have to explicitly pass after each time they add an object to the stack (see CR 116.3c).If anything, this shortcut is more important for what it doesn’t allow-—namely, a player hesitating after a play, fishing for a reaction from their opponent, and then claiming to have kept priority and acting with the knowledge of the opponent’s reaction.This also explains why Legacy players who play Infernal Tutor and Lion’s Eye Diamond must explicitly state that they keep priority after they play the tutor, otherwise their opponent will just say, “OK I pass!” and they will not be hellbent."></annotation>
            <point text="• If a player adds a group of objects to the stack without explicitly retaining priority, they are assumed to be adding them to the stack individually and allowing each to resolve before adding the next. If another player wishes to take an action at a point in the middle of this sequence, the actions should be reversed to that point."></point>
            <annotation text="This is relevant when dealing with cards that have an activated ability that pumps themselves (e.g. Shorecrasher Elemental); their controller can just say “I pump my Shorecrasher’s toughness six times” to speed up the game and, if their opponent wants to cast Mardu Charm on it choosing the four damage mode, they can still do so at any time. The opponent cannot argue that they played the Charm “as a response to the six abilities on the stack,” because under the first sentence, each ability is assumed to have already resolved before another one is added to the stack (because it can’t be done without priority). Therefore, if the opponent chose to play Mardu Charm after the sixth activation then the Elemental would have already been successfully pumped five times."></annotation>
            <point text="• If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces choices for it that are not normally made until resolution, the player must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell or ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during resolution, that player is assumed to be passing priority and allowing that spell or ability to resolve."></point>
            <annotation text="Players sometimes announce choices early when they assume their opponents don’t have any responses to their actions or when they are fishing for information. This shortcut prevents players from announcing choices early in order to trick opponents or improperly gain information and then making a different choice when the decision should properly be made. But if an opponent responds to the spell or ability, the controller may make any choice they choose, regardless of any announcements made.Example: Albert’s only creatures are 3 2/2 Wolf tokens, and he plays Honor’s Reward, saying: “I’ll gain 4 life and Bolster this token”. Norman answers with: “In response, I’ll Murder it”. Since the choice of which creature to Bolster is not made until the resolution of the spell, and Norman has responded to Honor’s Reward, Albert can change his choice to a different token when Honor’s Reward resolves. Also note that, in this scenario, not changing the choice would make the resolution of the spell illegal, since there are still valid choices on the battlefield when the spell resolves.Example: Andy casts Void targeting Naomi. Naomi asks what number Andy chooses, and Andy states one. It is now too late for Naomi to respond to Void, and Andy may not choose a different number."></annotation>
            <point text="• A player is assumed to have paid any cost of 0 unless they announce otherwise."></point>
            <annotation text="It is almost always in players’ best interests to pay a cost of 0 when an effect requires it, so this shortcut assumes they do so, unless they specifically announce otherwise. This both prevents less experienced players from being taken advantage of and allows them to concentrate on other parts of the game.Example: Player N attempts to prey on his opponent A’s ignorance by trying to use Clash of Wills to counter A’s spell when when X is zero, hoping that A will neglect to announce his choice to pay 0. This shortcut prevents this situation from becoming a problem."></annotation>
            <point text="• A player who casts a spell or activates an ability that targets an object on the stack is assumed to target the legal spell closest to the top of the stack unless the player specifies otherwise."></point>
            <point text="• A player is assumed to be attacking another player with their creatures and not any planeswalkers that player may control unless the attacking player specifies otherwise."></point>
            <annotation text="This is true for all attacking creatures that player controls, including any creatures put onto the battlefield attacking. The attacking player must explicitly state which creatures, if any, are attacking any planeswalkers controlled by the defending player as part of the turn-based actions of the declare attackers step (CR 508.1b). A player cannot wait to find out which of their creatures are unblocked before declaring that they are attacking a planeswalker.For creatures put onto the battlefield attacking, the attacking player must explicitly state if those creatures are attacking any planeswalkers controlled by the defending player as those creatures enter the battlefield (CR 508.4)."></annotation>
            <point text="• A player who does not scry/surveil when instructed to is assumed to have not looked and chosen to leave the cards in the same order."></point>
            <annotation text="This shortcut applies both scrying/surveiling as part of the resolution of a spell or ability as well as scrying after keeping a mulliganed hand. A big part of the reason for this change is not wanting to punish a player unjustly for ignoring information they have access to, but are not required to acquire. As a player is typically not required to access this information we also do not want to punish the opponent. Philosophically, looking at the top face of the library after taking a mulligan is functionally equivalent to the Scry mechanic, and fits here nicely."></annotation>
            <point text="• In the Two-Headed Giant format, attacking creatures are assumed to be attacking the head of the defending player sitting directly across from their controller, unless the creature's controller specifies otherwise."></point>
            <annotation text="So for example Anna and April are playing against Nataly and Nicholas, and Anna is sitting in front of Nataly and April is sitting in front of Nicholas. If in the declare attackers step neither Anna nor April specifies who they are attacking, it is assumed that Anna is attacking Nataly and April is attacking Nicholas. Therefore, if Anna attacks with a Thief of Sanity without saying who is she attacking and there are no blockers, when the triggered ability resolves she will look at the top 3 cards of Nataly’s library and exile one of them."></annotation>

            <annotation text="Players aren’t robots and don’t do everything perfectly, and judges shouldn’t expect them to. Magic isn’t a game of gotcha and players shouldn’t be punished for performing clear and otherwise legal actions in a way that feels more natural to them."></annotation>
            <point text="All actions taken must be legal if they were executed in the correct order, and any opponent can ask the player to do the actions in the correct sequence so that they can respond at the appropriate time (at which point players will not be held to any still-pending actions)."></point>
            <annotation text="Out-of-Order Sequencing cannot be used to perform illegal actions, but more importantly, it also cannot be used to deprive an opponent of their chance to respond at the appropriate time. If an opponent wishes to respond, all actions prior to the point of response must be performed in the correct order. The player suggesting out-of-order sequencing is free to change their choices that they would have made after the opponent’s response."></annotation>
            <point text="An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely gaining information which could reasonably affect decisions made later in that sequence."></point>
            <annotation text="An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely gaining information which could reasonably affect decisions made later in that sequence, because Out-of-Order Sequencing cannot be used to gain an advantage."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Example: A player casts Cruel Ultimatum, which among other things has its controller return a creature from their graveyard to their hand, draw three cards, and gain five life. The player may not draw cards before returning a creature to their hand, because the information gained from the drawn cards might influence which creature will be returned."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not try to use opponent's reactions to some portion of an out-of-order sequence to see if they should modify actions or try to take additional ones. Nor may players use out-of-order sequencing to try to retroactively take an action they missed at the appropriate time. In general, any substantial pause at the end of a completed batch is an indication that all actions have been taken, the sequence is complete and the game has moved to the appropriate point at the end of the sequence."></point>
            <annotation text="Generally, all actions in the sequence must be performed as one block, which means there can’t be any pauses between actions and or interaction with an opponent. Each substantial pause or attempt to see an opponent’s reaction should be treated as an end of the sequence."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Once again, Out-of-Order Sequencing cannot be used to gain an advantage. Therefore the sequence can’t contain previously missed actions nor can the player try to modify the sequence based on the opponent’s reaction to previous actions. “If you believe the player forgot to take an action and is now attempting to take it at a later time, that is not acceptable.”"></annotation>

        <point text="4.4 Loops">
            <point text="A loop is a form of tournament shortcut that involves detailing a sequence of actions to be repeated and then performing a number of iterations of that sequence. The loop actions must be identical in each iteration and cannot include conditional actions (“If this, then that”.)"></point>
            <point text="If no players are involved in maintaining the loop, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform before they will take an action to break the loop or that they wish to take no action. If all players choose to take no action, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number takes an action to break the loop."></point>
            <point text="If one player is involved in maintaining the loop, they choose a number of iterations. The other players, in turn order, agree to that number or announce a lower number after which they intend to intervene. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority."></point>
            <point text="If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop within a turn, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to perform. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority."></point>
            <point text="Loops may span multiple turns if a game state is not meaningfully changing. Note that drawing cards other than the ones being used to sustain the loop is a meaningful change. If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop across turns, each player chooses a number of iterations to perform, or announces their intent to continue indefinitely. If all players choose to continue indefinitely, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority at the point they stop taking an action to sustain the loop."></point>
            <point text="A player intervening during a loop may specify that one iteration of the loop is only partly performed in order to be able to take action at the appropriate point. If they do, the final iteration is only performed up to the chosen point."></point>
            <point text="Non-deterministic loops (loops that rely on decision trees, probability or mathematical convergence) may not be shortcut. A player attempting to execute a nondeterministic loop must stop if at any point during the process a previous game state (or one identical in all relevant ways) is reached again. This happens most often in loops that involve shuffling a library."></point>
            <point text="Some loops are sustained by choices rather than actions. In these cases, the rules above may be applied, with the player making a different choice rather than ceasing to take an action. The game moves to the point where the player makes that choice. If the choice involves hidden information, a judge may be needed to determine whether any choice is available that will not continue the loop."></point>
            <point text="The judge is the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop. A player may not 'opt-out' of shortcutting a loop, nor may they make irrelevant changes between iterations in an attempt to make it appear as though there is no loop. Once a loop has been shortcut, it may not be restarted until the game has changed in a relevant way. Proposing loops as an effort to use up time on the clock is Stalling."></point>

        <point text="4.5 Triggered Abilities">
            <point text="Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one is Cheating. Players are not required to point out the existence of triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they wish."></point>
            <point text="Triggered abilities are considered to be forgotten by their controller once they have taken an action past the point where the triggered ability would have an observable impact on the game."></point>
            <annotation text="Triggers happen all the time in a game of Magic and it can be difficult enough for a player to remember their own triggers, let alone opponents’ triggers. We don’t penalize players for not pointing out their opponent’s forgotten triggers, but it is cheating for a player to intentionally ignore their own triggers. Cheating is dealt with according to the IPG or JAR, as appropriate. If a player notices that their opponent forgot a trigger, they may point it out."></annotation>
            <point text="Triggered abilities that are forgotten are not considered to have gone onto the stack. How forgotten triggered abilities are subsequently handled is defined by the Rules Enforcement Level of the tournament."></point>

        <point text="4.6 Team/Two-Headed Giant Communication">
            <point text="Members of the same team may communicate between one another except during times where explicitly prohibited by the team format rules."></point>
            <annotation text="Players on a team may talk to their teammates at any time about nearly anything, with the below exception."></annotation>
            <point text="However, team members that have an opportunity to acquire hidden information (e.g. by speaking to spectators following their own match while a teammate is still playing), are restricted from communicating with teammates for the duration of that match."></point>
            <point text="Prohibitions against written notes of any kind during drafts apply to team drafts as well."></point>
            <annotation text="If a member of a team has access to hidden information from outside their teammate’s match, they must refrain from communicating with teammates who are still playing. Common occurrences of this are during team events, once a player has stood up and moved around after their match they have the potential to see hidden information from their teammate’s opponents. This doesn’t mean the players can’t use the restroom once they are done with their match, but they should call a judge to direct them. Most times judges will direct players to walk to the restroom so they can confirm they aren’t trying to gain information.See MTR 8.3."></annotation>

        <point text="4.7 Game Layout">
            <point text="Players in Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level matches must arrange their cards, tokens, and other accessories on the battlefield using the following layout:"></point>
            <point text="• From the player’s perspective, nonlands must be kept closer to the player’s opponent than lands, and no non-land cards should be between the land area and the edge of the table closest to the player."></point>
            <point text="• Non-creature permanents whose use may reasonably be associated with either the land or nonland area (e.g. an artifact whose only ability is a mana ability) may be located in either area, provided the overall layout is, in the judgment of tournament officials, clear. However, permanents that are also creatures (e.g. artifacts with March of the Machines on the battlefield, Dryad Arbor, or a Treetop Village that is currently a creature) must be placed in the nonland area. Players may not use other cards to intentionally obscure the presence of a permanent in any area of the battlefield."></point>
            <point text="• Each face should remain clearly associated with any permanents attached to it. For example, an Aura enchanting a land should be in the land area in contact with that land."></point>
            <point text="• The player’s library, graveyard, and exiled cards should be kept all to the left of the battlefield or all to the right of the battlefield at the player’s discretion."></point>
            <point text="• The player’s graveyard and exiled cards should be adjacent to the player’s library. All three should be distinct at all times."></point>
            <point text="• If a face is exiled by a permanent and that permanent includes a way to perform additional actions with the exiled face, the association of the two cards must be clear. Keeping the two cards together is recommended."></point>
            <point text="• Each untapped permanent should face its controller. Players are permitted to briefly turn a face upside-down as a memory aid."></point>
            <annotation text="If Banishing Light exiles a face, that face should be tucked under Banishing Light. If a player exiles 2 Plains and a Grizzly Bears with Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver, the Grizzly Bears should be tucked under Ashiok."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player’s board needs to have creatures in front of lands. Non-creature permanents whose main uses are for mana may be placed with or apart from the lands. Creatures who are also lands MUST be placed with creatures. This includes Dryad Arbor and animated man lands. This is to ensure a clear and consistent board state is maintained, and that everyone is aware of the board state."></annotation>
            <point text="Physical objects used to represent permanents must have a way of clearly representing any in-game status, such as whether a permanent is tapped. Sleeves or face backs that appear similar to any player’s sleeves or face backs may not be used. The Head Judge is the final authority on what may be used to represent permanents."></point>
			<point text="Tournament officials may make exceptions or additions to these guidelines at their sole discretion in order to keep each player’s game layout clear. Players in exceptional situations (e.g. a player playing a deck with no lands or a deck that makes significant use of the graveyard) should consult with tournament officials to determine what allowances, if any, will be made."></point>
            <annotation text="Legacy, for example, has some decks that are unlike most Magic decks in most formats. Dredge players typically will have a spread-out graveyard on what would normally be the battlefield because of how much they do with their graveyard. Likewise, “Oops, All Spells” and Belcher are combo decks that run few or no lands."></annotation>
        </point>
		<point text="4.8 Reversing Decisions">
            <point text="Players are expected to consider their options before taking an action and players are not usually allowed to take back an action that has been communicated to their opponent, either verbally or physically."></point>
            <annotation text="Chess has something called the “touch-move” rule, which means that if a player touches a piece on the board on their turn, they are bound to move that piece (or capture that piece if it’s an opponent’s) if they have a legal move. In Magic, announcing a legal action, either by moving a face or by verbal confirmation (saying “No blocks”, for example) might look alike that chess rule, and it could be reasonable to bound a player to that action."></annotation>
			<point text="Sometimes, a player will realize that they have made a wrong decision after making a play. If that player has not gained any information since taking the action and they wish to make a different decision, a judge may allow that player to change their mind."></point>
            <annotation text="HOWEVER, unlike chess that has a fixed number of pieces per player, and is limited to only one move per turn, Magic has a lot of different moving pieces that affects the game in different ways (life totals, cards in hand, the board state, etc) and there might be times in which, right after a move has been made, a player might realize that they might want to make a different move. It has been a common -and very informal- practice to allow players to change their mind about an action taken during the game, but it wasn’t written anywhere. Now, as long as no information has been gained in between, policy allows us to have players reversing that last decision."></annotation>
			<point text="Judges must carefully consider whether the player has gained information since making the play that might have affected the decision;"></point>
			<annotation text="How much information was gained in between is something that we have to be very cautious about, since information can be gained in many different ways. Even by letting a spell resolve, players might be giving information to their opponents. There are cases in which reversing a decision is fairly easy; for example, when opponents are tapped out and cannot respond there’s not that much exchange of information as opposed to a fully-untapped opponent that have ways to interact with the other player."></annotation>
			<point text="in particular, players may not try to use opponent reactions (or lack thereof) to see if they should modify actions they committed to."></point>
			<annotation text="It is common that players announces “bolt this creatNOWAITBOLTTHEOTHERONE”, and it is fairly reasonable to let those players alter their decision since they are actively avoiding adding more information to the table before they change their minds. It would be a whole different story if the player waited for the opponent to confirm before they announced they wanted to change their decision. This is not Magic: the Gotcha! and trying to bait an opponent’s reaction is off-limits for allowing a decision to be reversed."></annotation>
			<point text="If the judge cannot be sure no information was gained, they should not allow the decision to be changed."></point>
			<annotation text="Like when we are deciding whether to backup or not, the safest bet is always to leave things the way they are. If you don’t feel comfortable enough with the amount of information that’s been exchanged before you were involved, it’s fine to not allow the decision to be reversed. Use your own judgement here!"></annotation>
			<point text="Teammates intervening before information has been gained is acceptable when considering a backup."></point>
			<annotation text="Since we treat every player from a team as a single entity for the purpose of reporting the result of a match, and the fact that they can communicate with each other at all times during the match, it is also reasonable to take every member of the team into account when deciding whether to reverse a decision or not. If a player cast a creature, and one of their teammates says “No, cast this other one!”, it is ok to let them reverse that play, as long as no relevant information has been gained."></annotation>
        </point>
            <title text="Examples:"></title>
            <example text="1. A player plays an Island and, before anything else happens, says “Sorry, I meant to play a Swamp.”"></example>
            <example text="2. A player says “No blocks” immediately followed by “Wait, no, I block with this creature.”"></example>
            <example text="3. A player says “Go. Wait, land, go.”"></example>

    <point text="5. Tournament Violations">
        <point text="5.1 Cheating">
            <point text="Cheating will not be tolerated. The Head Judge reviews all cheating allegations, and if they believe that a player has cheated, they will issue the appropriate penalty based on the Infraction Procedure Guide or Judging at Regular Rules Enforcement Level document. All disqualifications are subject to DCI review and further penalties may be assessed."></point>
            <annotation text="In short, cheating occurs when a person breaks a rule, is aware that they are doing so, and is attempting to gain advantage from their action. For a more detailed discussion about cheating and how to handle this infraction, see IPG 4.8. The penalty for this infraction is Disqualification, and the Head Judge must follow the Disqualification Process."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="5.2 Bribery">
            <point text="The decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this manner. Making such an offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery."></point>
            <annotation text="Players can drop from an event, concede a match to their opponents, or agree to intentionally draw with their opponents. But they cannot ask for any kind of incentive or make any offer to the opponent in order to get a desired result. Similarly, a player cannot try to influence a player to take any other in-game action. Phrases like “If you concede to me, I’ll give you all my prizes” or “I will concede to you in exchange of half your prizes” are unacceptable, and Bribery results in a Match Loss at Competitive REL. At Regular REL, this kind of behaviour will spark a stern talk between you and the players, but do not disqualify them if they didn’t know that that was not legal. On the other hand, if the players knew that Bribery is not allowed, they are Disqualified for Cheating at all Rules Enforcement Levels."></annotation>
			<point text="Players may not make any offers to tournament officials in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling."></point>
            <annotation text="Players are also prohibited from attempting to bribe tournament officials, including judges."></annotation>
            <point text="It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may agree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament."></point>
            <point text="It is not bribery when players in the announced last round of the single-elimination portion of a tournament agree to a winner and how to divide the subsequent tournament prizes. In that case, one of the players at each table must agree to drop from the tournament. Players receive the prizes according to their final ranking."></point>
            <annotation text="Players in the Swiss rounds, for example, are allowed to split the prizes they will receive evenly. They may also agree to distributions like “the loser receives their entry back,” assuming that the prizes received will at least cover that amount."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The rules for discussing a split change during the announced final round of a single elimination playoff. If players wish to split the prizes, players must agree who is dropping from the event in order to divide prizes the way they want. It’s not a player actually conceding the match, but rather dropping."></annotation>
            <point text="The result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily determined through any means other than the normal progress of the game in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, flipping a coin, arm wrestling, or playing any other game."></point>
            <annotation text="The result of a Magic game or match should be determined only by playing Magic. No other method is allowed. This often happens near the end of a round when drawing would knock both players out of playoff contention but a concession by one would allow the other to advance. Many inexperienced players do not even realize that randomly determining a winner is illegal; being proactive with Head Judge announcements and late-round vigilance can help judges avoid giving Match Losses to players who otherwise might not know about this rule. See IPG 4.3."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For example, if a judge sees two players who are about to draw without any obvious win conditions on the board, they might simply remind the players that they cannot flip a coin or make any offers to their opponents to induce a concession. The judge might also remind them that they must report the game as a draw unless one of them wins or concedes. This proactive approach provides a better player experience than waiting for a player to say something unfortunate and avoids an unpleasant outcome for everyone."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other matches. Players can make use of information regarding match or game scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their seats during their match or go to great lengths to obtain this information."></point>
            <annotation text="While opponents may agree to intentionally concede or draw their matches, a group of players may not deliberate whether they should all draw in order to make Top 8, for example. Players may use information about the other matches to make up their minds, but they may not leave their seats during their match or go to other great lengths to obtain additional information."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For instance, players may play their match until the match next to them finishes and agree to draw because that result favors their chances at making Top 8. But they cannot make any extraordinary effort to get the information they want, like pausing the match to recheck the standings or pairings or to find out the results of the match three tables over. Players may not play slowly to wait on relevant matches to finish."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Some Head Judges and Tournament Organizers like to seat the final round’s matches randomly so that the top matches are not clumped together at the first few tables. Random seating makes it harder for players to observe the results of matches near them in standing."></annotation>
            <point text="Players in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering only cash, store credit, prize tickets, and/or unopened product as prizes may, with the permission of the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes evenly. The players may end the tournament at that point or continue to play. All players still in the tournament must agree to the arrangement."></point>
            <example text="Example: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and 3rd and 4th get 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the Tournament Organizer to end the tournament, with each player receiving 7 packs."></example>
            <example text="Example: In the finals of a 1-slot Players Tour Qualifier that offers a travel award and an invitation to the winner, the two finalists may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot alter the results of the match. One player must drop from the tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player who did not drop from the tournament. That player is then free to split the remainder of the prizes as agreed upon. The travel award and invitation are a single item and may not be split."></example>
            <annotation text="Note that, for the event to end at this point, players need to agree which of them is dropping, and the results must be reported as a “Win By Drop,” since no match took place. A prize split before the finals is only allowed when are no prizes other than cash and/or unopened product.

            <annotation text="Broadly, this section exists to spell out one very important responsibility that all players share: to not ruin the enjoyable atmosphere of the tournament. While the behaviors cited below all have the potential to do so, they are not an exhaustive list, nor could such a list be written. If a player’s behavior is disruptive to the event or is making you or another person uncomfortable, this is a problem that needs to be addressed."></annotation>
            <point text="• Using profanity."></point>
            <annotation text="The above prohibition should not be taken to mean that any use of profanity at a Magic event is automatically considered Unsporting Conduct. Indeed, many Magic players routinely use profanity as part of their everyday speech without a second thought, and it would be senseless to try to eradicate it completely. Profanity becomes problematic when it is disruptive to other people’s enjoyment of the event. This can happen, for example, when it is used excessively, or directed maliciously toward another person. Such cases are more serious and merit the intervention of a judge. See IPG 4.1 for details."></annotation>
            <point text="• Engaging in behavior that could reasonably be expected to create a feeling of being harassed, bullied, or stalked."></point>

            <annotation text="Judges and other Tournament Officials are the people players turn to in case of a problem. This includes interpersonal problems like Unsporting Conduct. It’s very rare for someone to ask for an intervention when one isn’t warranted; quite the opposite, people often ignore or deal with such problems longer than they reasonably should. For this reason, we need to treat all such allegations seriously and deal with them before they can escalate."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Consequences to discourage repeat behavior can include anything from a simple “Don’t do that,” to issuing an Unsporting Conduct penalty. Where a player has broken a venue or organizer’s rule — by smoking in the venue, for example — it may be necessary to involve representatives from these groups to resolve the issue."></annotation>

        <point text="5.5 Slow Play">
            <point text="Players must take their turns in a timely fashion regardless of the complexity of the play situation and adhere to time limits specified for the tournament. Players must maintain a pace to allow the match to be finished in the announced time limit. Stalling is not acceptable. Players may ask a judge to watch their game for slow play; such a request will be granted if feasible."></point>
            <annotation text="The round time limit is not equally split between players. This means that a player thinking too long to make plays is “stealing” time from their opponent. This can give them an unfair advantage or degrade an opponent’s play experience. Even when there are no time limits, one player taking too much time for their actions is wasting everyone’s time. For examples of Slow Play, see IPG 3.3."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Intentionally playing slowly to take advantage of time limit is considered Stalling. For more information about how to handle these infractions at Competitive Rules Enforcement Level, see IPG 4.7."></annotation>

        <point text="5.6 Outside Assistance">
            <point text="During matches, players may not seek play advice from spectators and spectators may not give play advice to players."></point>
            <point text="During deck construction, players and spectators may not provide any advice or commentary to a player until that player’s decklist has been handed in."></point>
            <point text="Players and spectators will refrain from providing any information about draft selections or strategies between pod announcement and the end of the draft. At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level, players and spectators are expected to remain silent during the draft."></point>
            <point text="Some of these restrictions may be waived due to official press or coverage; in these situations, the player will be informed of the revised expectations. Teammates in certain team tournaments are also excepted from these restrictions (see section 4.5)."></point>

    <point text="6. Constructed Tournament Rules">
        <point text="6.1 Deck Construction Restrictions">
            <point text="Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size. If a player chooses to use a sideboard, it may not contain more than fifteen cards."></point>
            <annotation text="This is one of the announcements that many Head Judges include before beginning a tournament. It holds true at any constructed tournament, and is fairly self-explanatory."></annotation>
            <point text="Except for cards with the basic supertype or cards with text that specifies otherwise, a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual face, based on its English face title."></point>
            <annotation text="For most cards, a player may only play a maximum of four copies of a given face across their entire seventy-five. There are currently fourteen exceptions to this rule: Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest, the five Snow-Covered variants, Relentless Rats, Shadowborn Apostle, Rat Colony and Persistent Petitioners. Note that you cannot get around this rule by using foreign or misprinted cards; the count is based on the English name of the face."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="6.2 Card Legality">
            <point text="A face may only be used in a particular format if the face is from a set that is legal in that format or has the same name as a face from a set that is legal in that format. Zendikar Expeditions and Masterpiece Series cards may only be played in formats where the face is already legal."></point>
            <annotation text="The complete format list is below in this section. Note that it is perfectly legal to use old cards, as long as a version of that face is legal in the format in question. For example, a player may use a Beta Lightning Bolt in Modern, even though Beta isn’t a part of Modern, because Lightning Bolt was printed in a Modern-legal set. Masterpiece cards are a special addition to a set, and not actually part of the set itself. Since they are opened in packs they are legal for limited, however they are only legal in constructed formats where the normal edition of the face is also legal."></annotation>
            <point text="Cards banned in a specific format may not be used in decks for that format. Cards restricted in a specific format may only have one copy in a deck, including sideboard."></point>
            <annotation text="If a face is banned, it cannot be used. If a face is restricted, it doesn’t follow the “four-of” rule above; rather than having up to four copies in a given seventy-five, a player may have at most one copy. As explained in section 6.5, Vintage is the only format with a restricted list."></annotation>

        <point text="7.1 Deck Construction Restrictions">
            <point text="Limited decks must contain a minimum of forty cards. There is no maximum deck size. Any drafted or opened cards not used in a player’s Limited deck function as their sideboard."></point>
            <point text="Players are not restricted to four of any one face in Limited tournament play."></point>
            <annotation text="One of the most frequent questions by newer players is if they are allowed to play more than four copies of a face in limited. The answer is yes! Note that they can of course play the cards in their main, or are allowed to have excess copies in their sideboard. A good idea is to have players who have more than four of particularly good cards mention it to you ahead of time. This can help offset any potential accusations of cheating."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="7.2 Card Use in Limited Tournaments">
            <point text="Cards must be received directly from tournament officials. This product must be new and previously unopened. Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, Grand Prix, and World Championship tournaments may have had boosters opened in order to stamp them. Each player (or team) must be given exactly the same quantity and type of product as all other players participating in the tournament. For example, if one player receives three Magic Origins boosters for a booster draft, all other players must also receive three Magic Origins boosters."></point>
            <point text="Only cards from the expansions of the boosters opened (and only cards opened or drafted in that player’s pool) may be used in a player’s deck. The following are exceptions to this rule:"></point>
            <point text="• Players may add an unlimited number of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or Forest to their deck and sideboard. They may not add additional snow basic land cards (e.g. Snow-Covered Forest, etc) or Wastes basic land cards, even in formats in which they are legal."></point>
            <point text="• Non-basic lands from the Return to Ravnica and Gatecrash expansions are allowed when opened in Dragon’s Maze boosters."></point>
            <point text="• Non-basic lands from the Khans of Tarkir expansion are allowed when opened in Fate Reforged boosters."></point>
            <point text="• Non-basic lands from the Zendikar Expeditions set are allowed when opened in Battle for Zendikar or Oath of the Gatewatch boosters."></point>
            <point text="• Cards from a Masterpiece Series are allowed when opened in boosters associated with that series."></point>
            <point text="• Prerelease tournaments may feature additional exceptions. These will be announced as part of the Prerelease information."></point>
            <point text="Players may ask a judge for permission to replace a face with another version of the same face."></point>
            <point text="Because it was designed specifically for multiplayer play, the use of Conspiracy boosters in sanctioned, rated Limited-format tournaments (Sealed Deck and Booster Draft) is not permitted."></point>
            <point text="Six boosters per player are recommended for individual format Sealed Deck tournaments and 3 boosters per player for individual Booster or Team Rochester Draft tournaments. For the recommended product mix for the current block, refer to Appendix D."></point>
            <point text="If the Tournament Organizer allows players to provide their own product, that product must be pooled with the rest of the product for the tournament and randomly distributed."></point>
            <point text="If the Tournament Organizer is not providing extra land cards for use in a Limited tournament, they must announce this before tournament registration. Tournament Organizers may require players to return these land cards when they leave the tournament. Players may use their own basic lands during tournaments."></point>
            <annotation text="Though they are not sanctioned (apart from perhaps casual unrated), Chaos drafts exist. Players in a Chaos draft are of course assigned product at random and do not need to receive the same product. Remember that if the event is sanctioned, then players do need to receive the same product as noted above."></annotation>
            <annotation text="As a reminder, players in Prerelease tournaments may use the foil promotional face they open, as that face is from the current set. As a small additional reminder, checklist cards that are opened may be used if the player has opened the appropriate dual sided face as well."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players may ask to replace a face with another version of the same face. Often players will ask for a proxy for foil cards. While this proxy should not be issued unless the face is opened damaged, the player may use an equivalent non-foil version if available."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players often prefer to use their own basic lands for a variety of reasons. While this is typically not an issue, be aware of foil basic lands that are marked (warped), or Alpha lands that cause particular markings on sleeves through the course of the day. While the lands themselves may be fine, the markings can become an issue."></annotation>

        <point text="7.3 Continuous Construction">
            <point text="Players participating in Limited tournaments that do not use decklists may freely change the composition of their decks between matches by exchanging cards from their deck for cards in their sideboard without being required to return their deck to its original composition before their next match. The Head Judge or Tournament Organizer must inform players if this option is not being used prior to the start of deck construction. This option is not available at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments."></point>
            <annotation text="The default for events that do not have a decklist is continuous construction. Remember that Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level events should have decklists, and thus the original composition needs to be restored prior to the start of each match."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="7.4 Abnormal Product">
            <point text="Neither Wizards of the Coast nor the Tournament Organizer guarantee any specific distribution of face rarities or frequency in a particular booster pack or tournament pack. If a player receives an unconventional distribution of rarities or frequencies in a particular booster pack or tournament pack, they must call a judge. The final decision to replace or allow the atypical product is at the discretion of the Head Judge and the Tournament Organizer."></point>
            <annotation text="Make sure to consult with the Tournament Organizer. Giving out replacement product costs them money."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players should open and verify a pack one at a time. It gets messy if someone is missing an uncommon/has an extra uncommon and they find out after all 6 packs are opened."></annotation>
            <annotation text="If a player is missing a face, the Head Judge can open a booster and pick a random face of that rarity to replace the missing one. If a player has an extra face, your options are to leave it, replace the whole pack, or have the player add a random face from the rarity of the extra one to their trade binder. It is generally best to minimize disruption to the pool by removing a face."></annotation>
            <annotation text="It is also worth noting that in the past Wizards of the Coast has rarely and (unintentionally?) put product from a future or previous set into a pack. If that occurs then this would also fall under the abnormal product policy listed here."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="7.5 Sealed Deck Pool Registration">
            <point text="In Sealed Deck tournaments, the Head Judge may require players to perform a Sealed Deck pool registration procedure prior to deck construction:"></point>
            <point text="• Each player is distributed the appropriate number of booster packs. The boosters should be marked in a way that distinguishes they came from the Tournament Organizer for that tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="A quick and easy way to mark the boosters can be to run a marker down one of the sides. This is easy and scales well to large events like Grand Prix. For smaller events Judges and TOs can use more personal touches like stickers to better uniquely identify the packs as belonging to the event."></annotation>
            <point text="• Players on one side of each table open their boosters (Player A). The player directly across (Player B) observes this. Both players will observe and verify the contents of those boosters. After this process, the opened cards are stacked face down in a single pile and placed near Player B."></point>
            <annotation text="When making announcements, it is important to let players know who is going first and who is going second. An easy way to denote this would be to tell players on a side of the table relative to a certain point, like the main stage or the Head Judge. For example “all players sitting on the sides of tables further away from the main stage will open packs first, followed by those closer.”"></annotation>
            <point text="• Player B will now open their boosters. Player A observes. Both players will observe and verify the contents. After this process, the opened cards are stacked face down in a single pile and placed near Player A."></point>
            <point text="• Player A then sorts and registers the contents of Player B's pool, and vice versa."></point>
            <point text="• After registration, each player returns the registered face pool to the player who originally opened the pool."></point>
            <point text="• Players construct and record decks as normal."></point>
            <annotation text="Sealed Deck Swap procedures are typical in Competitive Rules Enforcement Level events requiring decklists and help ensure that no one is trying to slip extra cards into their pool. By having other players register and observe the opening of the pool, we help minimize the ability of a player to slip additional cards in discretely. By seating players randomly for this, as is the norm, we help prevent collusion from friends who may get regularly seated together due to similar last names."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Previous methods went to even greater lengths to randomize the pool that a player would obtain to build, but lead to other problems. Details on the reasons for this change can be read about here."></annotation>
            <annotation text="We have realistically asked players to sort the pools for easy verification for some time now. Now we are making it more formal by requiring it via this document! It may be worth noting that some players may have trouble sorting the pools in a timely manner. If so please allot any resources available to help those players and keep the flow of the tournament moving."></annotation>

        <point text="7.6 Draft Pod Assembly">
            <point text="For Booster Draft and Team Rochester Draft tournaments, players assemble into random drafting circles (called pods) of roughly equal size at the direction of the Head Judge. Tournament officials then distribute identical sets of booster packs to each player."></point>
            <annotation text="Pods should be as close to 8 as you can get. In general, try to get pods of 6 or 8 over odd numbers to avoid byes. Typically, the software will sort players automatically into pods of these size. The pods created should be used unless an error has occurred."></annotation>
            <point text="Players within a pod may play only against other players within that pod. In Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may elect to lift this restriction. This must be announced before the tournament starts."></point>
            <annotation text="In general, players prefer playing against people in the same pod. Remember that a player losing to a player in a different pod may feel as though they have lost to measures outside of their control."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="7.7 Booster Draft Procedures">
            <point text="All players m	ust open and draft the same type of booster at the same time. Players open their first booster pack and count the cards face down, removing token cards, rules cards, and any other non-game cards. Players who receive an erroneous number of cards at any time must immediately notify a judge. Players choose one face from their current booster pack and then pass the remaining cards face down to the player on their left until all cards are drafted. Once a player has removed a face from the pack and put it on top of their single, front face-down drafted pile, it is considered selected and may not be returned to the pack."></point>
            <annotation text="Players changing their minds can cause problems or provide cover for sleight of hand shenanigans. It’s a good idea to have players put the tip/token/basic land face face up to avoid non-lands accidentally being removed from the pack."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not reveal the front face of their face selections or the contents of their current packs to other participants in the draft and must make a reasonable effort to keep that information from the sight of other players. Players are not permitted to reveal hidden information of any kind to other participants in the draft regarding their own picks or what they want others to pick. (Exception: This does not apply to double-faced cards, both faces of which may be revealed at any time during a draft.)"></point>
            <annotation text="Drafters should hold their cards so only they can view them. They may need to be reminded to keep their cards up."></annotation>
            <annotation text="If a player develops a case of wandering eyes, that’s bad. If you think they are doing so to get info on what’s in the next pack, please remove them from the event."></annotation>
            <point text="Players and teams may not look at their drafted cards between or during picks at Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Levels. At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, players are allowed to review their drafted cards between or during picks as long as they are holding no other cards at the same time. The Head Judge may choose to disallow this provided they announce it before the first draft. Between boosters there is a review period in which players may review their picks."></point>
            <point text="If the draft is not being timed, and two players do not wish to make a pick before the other player, the player closer to providing the other player with the pack picks first. If the players are equidistant, then the player in the lower seat number picks first."></point>
            <annotation text="Even though players can look at their picks in Regular Rules Enforcement Level, they must still draft at a reasonable pace. Please reinforce to players that they need to keep their picks and pack separate. Players are given a specific amount of time to examine their picks between each pack. For specific timing please see MTR Appendix B."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The last part about pick order is to deal with double-faced cards. Let’s say player 5 is waiting to pick based on player X’s pick. If X is from 2 to 4, 5 picks first. If X is from 6 to 8, X picks first. If X = 1, then X picks first."></annotation>
            <point text="After the first pack is drafted and the review period completed, players open the next pack and draft in the same fashion, except that the direction of drafting is reversed—it now proceeds to the right. This process is repeated, reversing the direction of drafting for each booster pack until all cards in all booster packs are drafted."></point>
            <point text="If a player is unable or unwilling to continue drafting, but wishes to remain in the tournament, they are suspended from drafting and must construct a deck from whatever cards they have drafted thus far. For the remainder of the draft, their picks are skipped and the draft continues with one fewer player."></point>
            <annotation text="It is very rare to see “unable or unwilling” being applied. If they are disqualified during a draft, the draft continues and skips over that seat."></annotation>

    <point text="8. Team Tournament Rules">
        <point text="8.1 Team Names">
            <point text="Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to disallow any team name it deems offensive and/or obscene. Tournament officials may disallow teams from registering team names that may be considered offensive and/or obscene."></point>
            <annotation text="It is important to remember that Wizards of the Coast is the ultimate arbiter in what may be deemed offensive. While certain names (come on, you know what they are) are directly offensive, others may also be deemed unacceptable. Do not be surprised if a name that subtly insults players or officials is not allowed. Similarly a name that touts another game or competitor may also be viewed as poor."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="8.2 Team Composition and Identification">
            <point text="A valid team consists of two or three members, as appropriate to the format. A team is identified by the individual DCI membership numbers of its respective members and all teams must provide the Tournament Organizer with the full information when registering for the tournament. Individuals may be members of more than one team, though not during the same tournament. If a player drops from the tournament, the entire team is dropped from the tournament. If a player is disqualified from the tournament, the entire team is disqualified from the tournament."></point>
            <point text="Teams must designate player positions during tournament registration. For example, in a three-player team tournament, each team must designate who is player A, player B, and player C. Players retain these designations throughout the entire tournament."></point>
            <point text="When two teams are paired against each other during the course of a tournament, the team members designated as “player A” play against each other, the team members designated as “player B” play against each other, and so on."></point>
            <annotation text="Teams being identified by their individual DCI numbers mean that even if a team should change names, as long as the same three people are members of the team they will still be counted in the same event history. Teams of course may not compete with only two members, and are not allowed to “start down a match” a common question."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Team seating is less important than making sure they play the correct opponent from the opposing team. If team member C would like to sit in the middle then that is fine, as long as both teams’ Cs are in the center. Teams should never intentionally scramble their orders mid tournament."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="8.3 Team Communication Rules">
            <point text="The rules for team communication are the same as those for Two-Headed Giant. See section 4.6 for more details."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="8.4 Unified Deck Construction Rules">
            <point text="Team Constructed tournaments use Unified Deck Construction rules: Except for cards with the basic supertype, no two decks on a team may contain the same face, based on its English face title. (For example, if one player is using Naturalize in a Team Constructed tournament, no other player on that team may use Naturalize in their deck.) No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format. Cards that override deck construction rules (i.e. Relentless Rats) may only override them for one deck on a team."></point>
            <point text="Unified Deck Construction rules are only applied when all members of a team have decks of the same format."></point>
            <annotation text="Note the change here! Prior to this update we had the “four of” rule, that simply applied across the team instead of across a deck. Now we only allow one player on a team to use any copies of a face. This makes checking legality considerably easier, both for teams and judges."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="8.5 Team Rochester Draft Tournaments">
            <point text="Team Rochester Draft tournaments require teams of three players each. Two teams are seated at each table for the draft. Team members sit clockwise in A-B-C order around the table. (For example, in a three-person team tournament, players sit around the table clockwise in this order: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C.)"></point>
            <point text="A team determined at random chooses either to pick first or to allow the other team to pick first. Player B of the team that picks first lays out the first pack."></point>
            <point text="The draft begins with the first player opening their first booster pack and laying out the entire contents of the pack face up on the table as directed by tournament officials, with the cards facing them. After reviewing the cards, drafting proceeds with each player selecting a single face in turn. Once a player has selected a face and placed it with their other drafted cards, they may not select a different face. If a player fails to select a face in the time given, a tournament official selects for that player the “oldest” face remaining from the booster pack (the face on the table the longest)."></point>
            <point text="The player drafting first from the cards presented on the table is called the active player. The first active player is the participant who opened the first booster of the draft, as designated by a tournament official. All players in each drafting pod serve as the active player once for each group of booster packs. The identity of the active player moves in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters and counter-clockwise for the second. The player who was last to open a booster pack from a group is the first to open the booster pack from the next group."></point>
            <point text="The draft order also begins moving in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters and counterclockwise for the second, beginning with the active player, continuing around the table to the last player in the group to draft a face. The last player in the group selects two cards sequentially, and then drafting continues in reverse order, moving back to the player who began the drafting. If there are still cards remaining, the player who began the drafting selects two cards, and drafting continues again in the opposite direction."></point>
            <example text="Example: Team 1 and Team 2 are seated around a table. They are numbered 1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C in a clockwise order. Team 2 wins the coin toss, and the members of Team 2 choose to let Team 1 pick first. The active player for the first pack is Player 1B. The first booster pack for Player 1B is opened and placed face up in front of Player 1B. After the 20-second review period has expired, the draft order is as follows:"></example>
            <example text="Player 1B — face 1 | Player 1A — face 6 | Player 1C — face 11"></example>
			<example text="Player 1C — face 2 | Player 1A — face 7 | Player 1B — face 12"></example>
			<example text="Player 2A — face 3 | Player 2C — face 8 | Player 1B — face 13"></example>
			<example text="Player 2B — face 4 | Player 2B — face 9 | Player 1C — face 14"></example>
			<example text="Player 2C — face 5 | Player 2A — face 10 | Player 2A — face 15"></example>
            <point text="During face selection, players must display the most recent face they drafted from the current pack. At all othertimes, players may leave one of their drafted cards face up on their draft pile or may leave all cards face down. Players may not review their draft picks while drafting proceeds or at any other time specifically indicated by tournament officials."></point>

            <point text="Eight boosters per team are recommended for two-person team tournaments, and twelve boosters per team for three-person team tournaments. For the recommended product mix for the current block, refer to Appendix D"></point>
            <point text="All cards must be assigned to a player’s deck or sideboard during deck construction and cannot be transferred to another player during that tournament. (Players do not share main deck or sideboard cards.) Players may exchange cards in their pool in Regular Rules Enforcement Level tournaments that do not use decklists, but only between rounds."></point>
            <annotation text="For competitive tournaments the recommended product mix in the appendix is highly preferred to allow players to have a reasonable expectation of the format, though technically any product may be used within the rules above.

        <point text="9.1 Match Structure">
            <point text="Two-Headed Giant matches consist of one game. All players from the two teams play in the same game."></point>
            <point text="Drawn games (games without a winner) do not count toward the one game. As long as match time allows, the match continues until a team has won a game."></point>
            <annotation text="Two-Headed Giant games are slower than regular ones, so there is only time for a single game in each match for tournaments to finish in a reasonable amount of time. Most of the following rules attempt to mitigate the extra randomness of single game matches."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This is a reference to different nature of Two-Headed Giant. The MTR isn’t the right place to explain the rules of Two-Headed Giant, they are contained in Magic Comprehensive Rules section 810."></annotation>

        <point text="9.3 Play-Draw Rule">
            <point text="A team determined at random chooses either to play first or to play second. The choice must be made before either player on that team looks at their hand. If either player on that team looks at their hand before their choice is made, that team plays first. The team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn."></point>
            <annotation text="This should just be a rewording of the regular matches’ Play-Draw Rule with the word “player” replaced with “team”. All that is missing is the two paragraphs dealing with game two and three. If a game two is happening because game one ended in a draw do feel free to refer to the regular rules in section 2.2 for how that works."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="9.4 Pregame Procedure">
            <point text="1. Players decide which teammate will be the primary player and which teammate will be the secondary player. Players should be seated with the primary player to the right of their teammate. Players can choose a different primary and secondary player before each match."></point>
            <annotation text="Technically this rule is very important. In practice it never matters. The major practical effect is that, if the players can’t agree on something, the primary player gets to decide (see CR 805.2). Additionally, opponents’ attacking creatures are presumed to be attacking the team’s primary player unless otherwise specified. See MTR 4.2 for more details."></annotation>
            <point text="2. Players shuffle their decks."></point>
            <annotation text="This means that each player is responsible for shuffling their own deck. This is consistent with each player being responsible for manipulating thei own cards in every other way."></annotation>
            <point text="3. Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling."></point>
            <annotation text="Just like in individual games, opponents are encouraged to shuffle their opponents’ cards to discourage cheating and promote randomness in shuffling."></annotation>
            <point text="4. The appropriate team must decide whether to play first or second at this point, if they have not done so already (see section 9.3)"></point>
            <point text="5. Each player draws seven cards. Optionally, these cards may be dealt face down on the table."></point>
            <annotation text="Another rule repeated so the reader doesn’t have to look anywhere else for the rule. We hope this rule isn’t a surprise to anyone. The instruction to draw the cards face down on the table helps a player avoid drawing an extra face."></annotation>
            <point text="6. Each player, in turn order, decides whether to mulligan. (Rules on Two-Headed Giant mulligans can be found in the Magic Comprehensive Rules, rule 103.4c)"></point>
            <annotation text="The Magic Comprehensive Rules do cover this, but it is pretty dry reading. Rule rule 103.4d is also relevant to how mulligans in Two-Headed Giant works. A worked example is very helpful. Let’s walk through how the two teams take their mulligans:"></annotation>
            <annotation text="- Alice and Alister have won the die roll and chosen to be on the draw. They look at their first seven cards, Alice doesn’t like her’s but Alister’s is fine and he declares that he will keep his. Alice starts shuffling."></annotation>
            <annotation text="- Nancy and Nigel look at their initial sevens and decide that they are both going to mulligan. They shuffle and Alice, Nancy and Nigel draw 7 new cards."></annotation>
            <annotation text="- Alice is happy with her second seven and declares that she is keeping, but Nancy and Nigel both choose to mulligan again. At this point Alister realises that he should have mulliganed, but it is too late and he must keep his original seven."></annotation>
            <annotation text="- Nancy and Nigel look at their six face hands and declare that they are happy with them. Mulligans are completed."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that the ‘seven’ above is not a typo. Remember that multiplayer formats have a free mulligan!"></annotation>

The open packs are passed around the drafting pod—with each team taking two cards from each before passing—until all cards are drafted."></point>
            <point text="For the second pack, the direction of drafting is reversed as usual. Thus, the overall draft direction is left–right– left–right–left–right."></point>
            <annotation text="The ideal situation here are pod sizes comparable to a typical draft. We would normally like to have six to eight players per pod and we want that here as well. This means three to four teams instead. You should not use six to eight teams per pod!"></annotation>
            <annotation text="Also remember that while drafting is typically a time without discussion, Two-Headed Giant is absolutely an exception. Players are allowed to communicate with their teammates and assist each other (as they are making picks together, as a team)."></annotation>

    <point text="10. Sanctioning Rules">
        <point text="10.1 Participation Minimums">
            <point text="Participation minimums for a tournament to be sanctioned as a rated tournament are as follows:"></point>
            <point text="• For individual tournaments, a minimum of eight (8) players must participate."></point>
            <point text="• For team and Two-Headed Giant tournaments, a minimum of four (4) teams must participate."></point>
            <point text="If the participation minimum is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned. If participation minimums are not met for any DCI-sanctioned tournament, the Tournament Organizer should report the tournament as “Did Not Occur.”"></point>
        </point>
        <point text="10.2 Number of Rounds">
            <point text="The minimum number of rounds required for a tournament to be sanctioned as a rated tournament is as follows:"></point>
            <point text="• For individual tournaments, a minimum of three (3) rounds."></point>
            <point text="• For team and Two-Headed Giant tournaments, a minimum of two (2) rounds."></point>
            <point text="If the minimum number of rounds is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned. If the minimum number of rounds is not met for any DCI-sanctioned, rated tournament, the Tournament Organizer should report the tournament as “Did Not Occur.”"></point>
            <point text="The number of rounds should be announced at or before the beginning of the first round; once announced, it cannot be changed. A variable number of rounds can be announced instead, with specific criteria for ending the tournament. For example, a tournament with 20 players can be announced as five rounds unless only one player has four match wins after four rounds."></point>
            <point text="The recommended number of rounds for Swiss tournaments can be found in Appendix E."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="10.3 Invitation-Only Tournaments">
            <point text="Invitation-only tournaments have additional qualification criteria for player participation. The invitation list for Premier tournaments is defined in the Magic: The Gathering Premier Event Invitation Policy. Tournament Organizers may hold and sanction invitation-only non-Premier tournaments, as long as they are sanctioned as a Magic Premier Series."></point>
        </point>
        <point text="10.4 Pairing Algorithm">
            <point text="Unless otherwise announced, tournaments are assumed to follow the Swiss pairing algorithm. Some tournaments may proceed to single-elimination playoff rounds between the top 2, 4, or 8 (or other number) players after the Swiss rounds are over. The Swiss pairing algorithm is modified in Booster Draft tournaments as explained in section 7.6."></point>
            <point text="For constructed tournaments that have a single-elimination playoff (or sealed deck tournaments that do not use a booster draft for the playoff), the recommended pairing method is to pair the playoff players by the final Swiss standings."></point>
            <point text="For an 8-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 8th place player, the 2nd place player plays the 7th place player, the 3rd place player plays the 6th place player, and the 4th place player plays the 5th place player. The winners of the 1st/8th place and 4th/5th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners of the 2nd/7th place and 3rd/6th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The remaining players play in the last round of the playoff."></point>
            <point text="For a 4-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 4th place player, and the 2nd place player plays the 3rd place player. The remaining players play in the last round of the playoff."></point>
            <point text="For Limited tournaments that have a single-elimination booster draft playoff, it is recommend that only an 8- player playoff is run using the following method described below."></point>
            <point text="Use a random method to seat players around the draft table and conduct the draft"></point>
            <point text="After the draft has concluded, the player in seat 1 plays the player in seat 5, the player in seat 2 plays the player in seat 6, the player in seat 3 plays the player in seat 7, and the player in seat 4 plays the player in seat 8. The winners of the seat 1/5 and the 3/7 matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners of the seat 2/6 and the seat 4/8 matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The remaining players play in the last round of the playoff."></point>
            <point text="For most Premier Events, the playoff options above are required, not optional."></point>
            <point text="Premier Events include the following tournaments: Magic: The Gathering World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, WPN Qualifiers, WPN Preliminary Events, Players Tour Qualifiers, Magic Premier Series, Grand Prix and Grand Prix Trials."></point>
			<point text="Exception: Grand Prix Trials and Players Tour Qualifiers that are run at MagicFest™ events have special structures.

	<point text="Appendix C — Tiebreaker Explanation">
        <title text="Match Points"></title>
		<point text="Players earn 3 match points for each match win, 0 points for each match loss and 1 match point for each match ending in a draw. Players receiving byes are considered to have won the match."></point>
        <title text="Game Points"></title>
		<point text="Game points are similar to match points in that players earn 3 game points for each game they win and 1 point for each game that ends in a draw, and 0 points for any game lost. Unfinished games are considered draws. Unplayed games are worth 0 points."></point>
        <title text="Match-win percentage"></title>
		<point text="A player’s match-win percentage is that player’s accumulated match points divided by the total match points possible in those rounds (generally, 3 times the number of rounds played). If this number is lower than 0.33, use 0.33 instead. The minimum match-win percentage of 0.33 limits the effect low performances have when calculating and comparing opponents’ match-win percentage."></point>
        <title text="Game-win percentage"></title>
		<point text="Similar to the match-win percentage, a player’s game-win percentage is the total number of game points they earned divided by the total game points possible (generally, 3 times the number of games played). Again, use 0.33 if the actual game-win percentage is lower than that."></point>
        <title text="Opponents’ match-win percentage"></title>
		<point text="A player’s opponents’ match-win percentage is the average match-win percentage of each opponent that player faced (ignoring those rounds for which the player received a bye). Use the match-win percentage definition listed above when calculating each individual opponent’s match-win percentage."></point>
        <title text="Opponents’ game-win percentages"></title>
		<point text="Similar to opponents’ match-win percentage, a player’s opponents’ game-win percentage is simply the average game-win percentage of all of that player’s opponents. And, as with opponents’ match-win percentage, each opponent has a minimum game-win percentage of 0.33."></point>
        <title text="Byes"></title>
		<point text="When a player is assigned a bye for a round, they are considered to have won the match 2–0."></point>
		<point text="Thus, that player earns 3 match points and 6 game points. A player’s byes are ignored when computing their opponents’ match-win and opponents’ game-win percentages."></point>
