	<title text="Introduction"></title>
		<point text="The Magic™ Infraction Procedure Guide provides judges the appropriate penalties and procedures to handle rules violations that occur during a tournament held at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level (REL), as well as the underlying philosophy that guides their implementation. It exists to protect players from potential misconduct and to protect the integrity of the tournament itself. Rules violations usually require a penalty or they are unenforceable. Tournaments run at Regular REL use the Judging at Regular REL document."></point>
		<title text="Framework of this document"></title>
		<point text="This document is divided into two major parts: General Definitions and Philosophy (section 1), and Infractions (sections 2-4). Infractions are broken down into general classes (Game Play Errors, Tournament Errors, and Unsporting Conduct), and further into subclasses for specific infractions."></point>
		<point text="See the Magic Tournament Rules for further definitions of terms in this document."></point>

		<title text="Annotated IPG"></title>
		<point text="The Annotated IPG is a line by line deconstruction of each sentence in the IPG. The IPG is a very dense document with very few extraneous words. Each sentence has meaning, and it’s the AIPG’s goal to call attention to the finer details hidden in those sentences. It can be used as a study guide for L2, a refresher for judges coming back, or to settle judge nerd-fights, but its primary focus is education"></point>

	<point text="1. General Philosophy">
		<point text="Judges are neutral arbiters and enforcers of policy and rules."></point>
		<annotation text="This is probably the single most important concept in the document. Whenever there is an issue, judges should evaluate the situation without bias and in accordance to the rules and policy documents.  It should be inconceivable that a judge ruled in favor of a player because they are friends or because somehow the judge likes one player more than the other. Being impartial is a fundamental concept in the Judge Code of Conduct. Judges are viewed with respect, in large part, because they are neutral and because they enforce the policy equally.  It should also be unimaginable that a judge creates rules or rulings without policy guidance."></annotation>
		<point text="A judge shouldn’t intervene in a game unless they believe a rules violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question requests assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating."></point>
		<annotation text="Judges are there for the players. Our services are needed when a rule has been violated, a player has some need, or there is a delicate situation like an argument and it’s necessary to calm the players down. When their assistance is not needed, judges should not interfere with matches. That means no comments about game actions, no risk of giving advice, and no disruption of the player’s concentration. Let players play. Keep in mind this doesn’t mean you have to be a robot. You can still chat with players, and joke around with them, just don’t interrupt their games."></annotation>
		<point text="Judges don’t stop play errors from occurring, but instead deal with errors that have occurred, penalize those who violate rules or policy, and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy."></point>
		<annotation text="Like in many other sports, judges don’t prevent mistakes. However, when a game infraction happens, judges step in and apply the necessary corrections and penalties. Players cannot depend on a judge to prevent their illegal actions from occurring, because judges can’t foresee the future and game actions happen quickly. In the vast majority of cases, fixing an infraction after it happens restores the correct flow of the game. This policy also holds when a judge is watching a match at the end of round or during a Top 8."></annotation>
		<annotation text="It’s also important that judges set a good example of behavior. At an event, your attitude is an advertisement for the behaviors you want to see at events.  Your attitude and actions have a pronounced impact on the tone of the event. Your role is largely a customer service role, and that requires a high degree of diplomacy."></annotation>
		<point text="Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a game."></point>
		<annotation text="While it’s next to impossible to see that a game infraction is about to happen, sometimes it’s possible to see that an outside-of-game infraction that is about to happen. In these cases, judges should step in and prevent infractions from happening. The “may” in the sentence is not “the judge is allowed to make a choice” but more “The IPG/MTR allows judges to do step in.” This underscores the importance of customer service and makes it very clear that judges do not have the choice of whether to intervene and prevent these types of errors. Outside of a game, judges should always intervene to prevent infractions, but we accept that they sometimes won’t notice that an infraction is about to happen. Here are a few examples:"></annotation>
		<annotation text="- A judge sees that a player is shuffling their deck after the end of game one, sees that there is a previously exiled creature on the table, and realizes that the player forgot to return it to their deck; the judge steps in and tell the player that they’re forgetting to shuffle a card."></annotation>
		<annotation text="- In a Sealed Deck tournament, a player gives a decklist to a judge, and the judge notices that the player forgot to write down her basic lands; the judge asks the player to record the basic lands they’re playing."></annotation>
		<annotation text="- Just before the beginning of a round, a player goes to the judge station and hands in a card (like Pacifism) that belongs to her previous opponent; the judges makes an effort to find where the owner of that card is playing this round, so that they can return it before the game starts with an illegal deck."></annotation>
		<annotation text="- Before the event, a judge sees a questionable card alter. The Judge reminds the player that the head judge needs to approve all card alters prior to the event."></annotation>
		<point text="Knowledge of a player’s history or skill does not alter an infraction, but it may be taken into account during an investigation."></point>
		<annotation text="We don’t change the infraction based on how good the player is perceived to be. A GRV is a warning regardless of whether the player is new or a grizzled Pro. Once you determine what the infraction was, you apply the penalties without any preconceived biases.  You don’t make penalties harsher because the player should ‘know better’. A player who has a reputation for being shady has their GRVs fixed the same way as an L3 Judge playing in the event. Once the infraction is recognized, who the player is has no bearing. However, in determining what infraction was made, a player’s history may influence the investigation. For example, a new player misunderstanding how trample works is much more believable than an experienced player, with whom you have discussed Trample before on multiple occasions. It’s still possible for legitimate errors to be made, but the questions asked in the investigation will be influenced by this knowledge."></annotation>
		<point text="The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar mistakes in the future."></point>
		<annotation text="Penalties don’t exist to give sadistic judges the ability to inflict pain on defenseless players. Penalties exist to reduce the chance the error will happen again. A player who receives a penalty for an action is less likely to make the same error in the future. Generally they are meant to be something tangible to reinforce the lesson “I lost a game once for this mistake, and I don’t want to lose another game for something I can easily avoid, I will count to 60 every time I write a decklist”. The primary purpose of a penalty is not tracking; although that is a convenient and useful byproduct, the purpose is education."></annotation>
		<point text="This is done through both an explanation of where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to reinforce the education."></point>
		<annotation text="So in the sentence above we are stressing the importance of education. A penalty alone can’t do that. You also have to explain (briefly) what the player did wrong. Otherwise, they might not fully understand what went wrong."></annotation>
		<point text="Penalties are also for the deterrence and education of every other player in the event and are also used to track player behavior over time."></point>
		<annotation text="We should also note that you don’t have to receive a penalty to recognize that you don’t want to receive one. Hearing about a friend getting a penalty for an action helps reinforce that you don’t want one either. We learn from our friend’s mistakes as well as from our own."></annotation>
		<annotation text="There is a (private) archive of all the penalties, just like the (public) archive of all match results. This archive becomes useful in the case of one player committing a high number of the same infraction. If a player receives a warning for “Looking at extra cards – They revealed their opponent’s cards while shuffling their opponent’s deck before the beginning of the match” for twenty times in twenty consecutive tournaments, well, wouldn’t you believe that their doing it on purpose and they are doing it only once just because they knows that “the first time is just a warning.”"></annotation>
		<point text="If a minor violation is quickly handled by the players to their mutual satisfaction, a judge does not need to intervene."></point>
		<annotation text="Judges should be seen as a benefit to the players, and there are many minor/tiny mistakes that players make and correct themselves over the course of a match without the need for a judge. If the error is tiny, and the players fix it themselves, and are both happy, then the judge does not need to insert themselves into their game.  If you see an error, you can wait a second to see if the players fix it themselves, and if they do, you can continue watching Magic."></annotation>
		<point text="If the players are playing in a way that is clear to both players, but might cause confusion to an external observer, judges are encouraged to request that the players make the situation clear, but not assess an infraction or issue any penalty."></point>
		<annotation text="Players take certain shortcuts, or use beads to represent odd things, or use the wrong tokens for creatures. These things might be clear to them, but not clear to observers (including judges). If the players understand what’s going on, and everything is fine, don’t issue a penalty. Just ask them to play in a way that’s clearer. Often we get spectators coming to us with problems that aren’t really problems. For this reason we must push the players to not only be clear with each other but also to ensure that their actions are clear to anyone who is watching their game."></annotation>
		<point text="In both these situations, the judge should ensure that the game progresses normally."></point>
		<annotation text="If the players fix a tiny error themselves or are playing in a way that is clear to them, but not clear to bystanders, stick around and watch and make sure nothing odd is happening,  We don’t want a player taking advantage of the confusion, or the error compounding on itself."></annotation>
		<point text="More significant violations are addressed by first identifying what infraction applies, then proceeding with the corresponding instructions."></point>
		<annotation text="This sentence pulls double-duty. It’s a reminder that we do give infractions in cases larger than “tiny” and that we do not start with the penalty and work backwards to the infraction. We identify what actions occurred, what the infraction is, and then determine the penalty. We do not give people Game Losses because their error seems worth a game loss."></annotation>
		<point text="Only the Head Judge is authorized to issue penalties that deviate from these guidelines."></point>
		<annotation text="When there are multiple judges, the Head Judge is the judge in charge of the entire tournament; the only one who has the authority to determine if a specific penalty doesn’t apply well to the current situation. Head judges are usually the most experienced judges available, and when they decide to deviate it’s usually for a good reason."></annotation>
		<point text="The Head Judge may not deviate from this guide’s procedures except in significant and exceptional circumstances or a situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance."></point>
		<annotation text="Of course, although the Head Judge has the authority to deviate any time he or she wants, he or she is also expected to know when it is appropriate to deviate. The main reason for deviation is when a specific situation doesn’t fit well in the categories listed in the twenty pages of the IPG. The only case where a deviation is justifiable is when the situation is both significant and exceptional."></annotation>
		<point text="Significant and exceptional circumstances are rare—a table collapses, a booster contains cards from a different set, etc."></point>
		<annotation text="Here you have a couple of examples of “exceptional circumstances”. In these cases, we use common sense and we try to find the “best solution” with the players. Both of the examples above are both significant and exceptional. Make sure your situation is both before you consider deviating.  If you find yourself considering a deviation, give it a serious second thought."></annotation>
		<point text="The Rules Enforcement Level, round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are not exceptional circumstances."></point>
		<annotation text="Some of these situations might make it seem like it’s OK to deviate, but it’s not. You are to enforce policy regardless of whether it’s the last round, regardless of if the call is at table 1 or table 101. The opponents might be an exceptionally young age, but that age difference is not significant in terms of policy. The player might be new, and not know that rolling a die to determine a winner is prohibited; that player is still going to be Disqualified regardless of whether you think it is ‘fair’ or not. And finally, being a Level 3 Judge does not bestow upon that judge the right to deviate. In truth, they are held to a stricter standard, as lower level judges are watching and learning from their actions."></annotation>
		<point text="If another judge feels deviation is appropriate, they must consult with the Head Judge."></point>
		<annotation text="Just because the Head Judge is the only one that’s allowed to deviate doesn’t mean a floor judge can’t suggest it to the Head Judge. However, as a floor judge, you must never deviate."></annotation>
		<point text="Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, they should acknowledge the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it if it is not too late."></point>
		<annotation text="Despite all efforts to train Golden Retrievers, we judges are still only human. For now."></annotation>
		<annotation text="Humans make mistakes. It’s a fact of life. No one can be 100% correct all the time, and it is unrealistic to expect otherwise. However, when you do make a mistake, you need to take ownership of it and fix it if you can. Players cannot be allowed to continue thinking that something a judge incorrectly told them is correct. In all cases though, you need to apologize to the players for your error. Sometimes it’s best to do this right away, sometimes it’s less disruptive to do it after the match is over. But apologize to both players as soon as it is possible, and correct the situation. Players are typically very understanding, even when they were on the receiving end of an incorrect call."></annotation>
		<point text="If a member of the tournament staff gives a player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the Head Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty."></point>
		<annotation text="We expect players to trust their tournament officials, and players need to be able to act on the instructions/information we provide them. It is unfair to penalize them for trusting the people they are supposed to be able to trust. However, this downgrade decision still rests with the HJ. For this clause we need two things 1) the Judge to provide erroneous information and 2) A violation be the direct result from the faulty information."></annotation>
		<point text="For example, a player asks a judge whether a card is legal for a format and is told yes. When that player’s deck is found to be illegal because of these cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the decklist, but may downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the direct error of the judge."></point>
		<annotation text="Other examples might include:"></annotation>
		<annotation text="– Downgrading a Game Rule Violation Warning to no penalty if a judge tells a player that they can untap two untapped lands with Teferi, Hero of Dominaria."></annotation>
		<annotation text="– Downgrading a Deck/Decklist Problem Game Loss to a Warning if a judge has previously told the player that registering “Jace” on thier Decklist is fine."></annotation>
		<point text="If a player clearly acts on erroneous information provided by a judge during the game, the Head Judge may consider a backup to the point of the action taken, even if that action did not lead to a violation."></point>
		<annotation text="We expect players to trust the information provided by their tournament officials, as detailed already.  Normally a backup could only be considered if an infraction had been committed, but in the same way that it is unfair to penalize a player for trusting the information provided, it is also unfair for a player to have made a decision based upon that information even if it doesn’t result in an infraction."></annotation>

            <point text="Warning">
                <point text="Warnings are used in situations of incorrect play when a small amount of time is needed to implement the corrective procedure."></point>
                <annotation text="Warnings are typically issued when judges have to step in to correct a situation. The main purpose of warnings is to give ‘weight’ to the reminder to play more carefully. It’s written down and tracked, therefore it’s significant, but it doesn’t need to be scary."></annotation>
                <point text="The purpose of a Warning is to alert judges and players involved that a problem has occurred and to keep a permanent record of the infraction."></point>
                <annotation text="A Warning needs to be tracked and judges should write it down on the back of the result slips (if you are using them). The Scorekeeper will input the warning penalty into the tournament software to track the infraction. Scorekeepers can notify you when a player is close to an upgrade, and players need to be aware of how many penalties they have."></annotation>
                <point text=" A time extension should be issued if the ruling has taken more than a minute."></point>
                <annotation text="If fixing the game state has taken more than one minute, give a time extension equal to the time taken, unless the match is in extra turns. You did look at the clock before walking up to the table, right?"></annotation>
            </point>
            <point text="Game Loss">
                <point text="A Game Loss ends the current game immediately and the player who committed the infraction is considered to have lost the game for the purpose of match reporting. The player receiving a Game Loss chooses whether to play or draw in the next game of that match, if applicable. If a Game Loss is issued before the match begins, neither player in that match may use sideboards (if the tournament uses them) for the first game they play."></point>
                <annotation text="If a player gets a Game Loss, that game is over. Board position or “but they were going to lose anyway” doesn’t factor into the decision. The rest of this block tells us what to do for the next game. The player with the Game Loss… lost. So that player gets to decide if they play or draw in the next game in the match. However, if the Game Loss is issued before the first game, the players haven’t actually played a game yet, so they don’t get a chance to sideboard."></annotation>
                <point text="Game Losses are applied immediately if the game is still ongoing, or to the player’s next game if it is not, unless otherwise specified. If a player would receive two or more Game Losses at the same time, they only receive one."></point>
                <annotation text="The default time to apply a Game Losses is immediately. If there is no game going on, you apply the penalty to the next game that you can, even if its in a different match. However, there are a few infractions where the penalty specifically tells you to apply the penalty at a specific time. Mostly this is for a Decklist Problem discovered through decklist counting."></annotation>
                <point text="If a player would receive two or more Game Losses at the same time, they only receive one."></point>
                <annotation text="The infractions don’t have to happen at the same time; if you’re going to write two or more Game Losses on the match slip in one go you will only issue one. While relatively rare it is most likely to come up during a deck check, where multiple infractions could occur as part of the one check. Another scenario is handing a decklist in late, then before the round starts needing to fix the list because of mis-registering lands. A Game Loss is always a significant penalty, receiving 2 or more for infractions discovered at the same time essentially converts the penalty into a match loss which doesn’t fit the infractions. Although it may feel like the player is getting away with no penalty for the other infraction or infractions, they are still receiving the same penalty they would have for that infraction and they are all being recorded."></annotation>
				<point text="If simultaneous Game Loss penalties are issued to each player, they are recorded, but do not affect the match score."></point>
                <annotation text="This covers situations where both players have an illegal deck, or other similar circumstances. If we issue both players with a Game Loss penalty, only one game in the match will determine the winner and it’s always better for both players to play a complete match. To remedy this, you record both penalties, end the current game (if it is still being played) and both players continue to the next game. For the purpose of reporting the score, that specific game didn’t happen."></annotation>
            </point>
            <point text="Match Loss">
                <point text="A Match Loss is a severe penalty that is usually issued when the match itself has been compromised."></point>
                <annotation text="There are three infractions that result in a Match Loss penalty. Upgrading Tardiness; Outside Assistance and Unsporting Conduct – Major."></annotation>
                <annotation text="Note that it is possible for a match to become compromised but still continue such as if a spectator commits Outside Assistance."></annotation>
                <point text="Match Losses are applied to the match during which the offense occurred unless the offender’s match has already ended, in which case the penalty will be applied to that player’s next match."></point>
                <annotation text="If the match has already ended, apply the penalty to the next match."></annotation>
            </point>
            <point text="Descalificación (Disqualification)">
                <point text="A Disqualification is issued for activity that damages the integrity of a tournament as a whole or for severe unsporting conduct."></point>
                <annotation text="Disqualifications are for the most severe infractions. Don’t feel bad about these. Remember, you don’t give penalties. Players earn them."></annotation>
                <point text="The recipient of a Disqualification does not need to be a player in the tournament. They may be a spectator or other bystander. If this happens, they must be entered into the tournament in Wizards Event Reporter (“WER”) so that they may be disqualified and reported to the DCI."></point>
                <annotation text="Entering the spectator or bystander into the event ensures that there is a record of the DQ and the information can be used by the Investigations Committee. Get the person’s name or DCI number, even if you have to ask around. Remember to collect statements and enter an investigation report."></annotation>
                <point text="Disqualification can occur without proof of action so long as the Head Judge determines sufficient information exists to believe the tournament’s integrity may have been compromised. It is recommended that the Head Judge’s report reflect this fact."></point>
                <annotation text="Magic events are not a court of law, nor an episode of CSI:Miami. You do not need a smoking gun or DNA evidence. The Head Judge does not need to prove that their decision is right, they just need sufficient information to justify it. However, if you disqualify without evidence, you need to record that as well. And the investigation committee still has the right to ask the Head Judge to explain why they thought the player should be disqualified."></annotation>
                <point text="When this penalty is applied, the player loses their current match and is dropped from the tournament. If a player has already received prizes at the time they are disqualified, that player may keep those prizes but does not receive any additional prizes or awards they may be due. A player that is disqualified from a tournament does not receive Planeswalker Points or Professional Points for that tournament."></point>
                <annotation text="When a player is disqualified from the tournament, their event is over. The results of the matches or games they have finished won’t be changed, and if the player has already received prizes prior to the Disqualification, they get to keep what has already been received. However, they are not given anything they are yet to receive. This is mainly to avoid the legal complications of “taking back” something that has already been given. It’s important to inform the player that they will not receive any planeswaler points for the tournament."></annotation>
                <point text="When a player is disqualified during a tournament, they are removed from the tournament and do not take up a place in the standings. This means that all players in the tournament will advance one spot in the standings and are entitled to any prizes the new standing would offer. If the Disqualification takes place after a cut is made, no additional players advance in place of the disqualified player although they do move up a spot in the standings. For example, if a player is disqualified during the quarterfinal round of a Magic Tabletop Mythic Qualifier, the former 9th place finisher does not advance into the single elimination top 8, but they do move into 8th place in the standings."></point>
                <annotation text="This paragraph is to tell judges (and players) what happens when a player is disqualified. A very common question is “Well, now that a spot in the Top 8 is available, can 9th place get it?” The answer is: if it’s after the cut, no you can’t."></annotation>

        <point text="1.2. Applying Penalties">
            <point text="Penalties are included with the tournament report so that a permanent record can be kept in the DCI Penalty Database."></point>
            <annotation text="Penalties need to be entered into the system. For both tracking within the event and for whatever purpose Wizards of the Coast uses them for once they go into the black hole. Mostly this sentence is just here as a gentle reminder to actually enter the penalties for the event into WER."></annotation>
            <point text="Additionally, any penalty of Game Loss or higher should be reported to the Head Judge, and it is recommended that only the Head Judge issue penalties of this nature (with the exception of Tardiness (3.1) and Decklist Problems (3.4))."></point>
            <annotation text="Game Losses are a “big deal” and difficult to correct if they are issued by mistake. As a result, it is recommended that the Head Judge be consulted prior to giving any Game Loss or Match Loss. As for Disqualifications, only the Head Judge can give those. The reason Tardiness and Decklist Problems get an exception is because there is actually very little judgment involved in a Tardiness Game Loss (and they are extremely common), and the same holds true for Decklist Problems. However, if the judge is on a team, it is recommended that they go through their Team Lead. At some events, the Head Judge may modify this policy. A common modification at Grand Prix events is that a Level 3 judge can issue Game Losses instead of having to consult the Head Judge. At Mythic Championship Qualifiers or StarCityGames Opens it is not uncommon for Team Leaders to have the authority to issue Game Losses."></annotation>
            <point text="Being enrolled in the tournament is not a requirement to receive a penalty. Although these guidelines refer to players, other people in the venue, such as spectators, staff, or judges may be enrolled into (and dropped from) the tournament in order to receive a penalty. Penalties are still issued even if a player drops from the tournament before it would take effect."></point>
            <annotation text="The main purpose of this sentence is to explicitly answer the question, “What do I do if a person not enrolled in my event is doing these things?” There are no distinctions made between tournament attendees when it comes to any kind of  penalties. If you commit an infractions and are not enrolled in the event, you will be added to the event in the Reporter Software and given the appropriate penalty. If a spectator is acting aggressively, then that is something that needs to be tracked. You can do something ban-worthy at an event you aren’t enrolled in. If a spectator is giving outside assistance for example, we need to keep track of it."></annotation>
            <point text="Any time a penalty is issued, the judge must explain the infraction, the procedure for fixing the situation, and the penalty to all players involved."></point>
            <annotation text="If a judge is going to give a penalty to a player, they should take the time to explain what the infraction is, and what the fix is. The judge should politely and professionally answer any reasonable questions the players might ask. Players called you for help — so be helpful. Make sure the players understand what you are telling them to do. Sometimes they won’t understand ‘why’; in those cases, make an attempt to explain, but if the explanation is taking too long, tell the players to continue and remind them they can speak to you after the match."></annotation>
            <point text="If the Head Judge chooses to deviate from the Infraction Procedure Guide, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard penalty and the reason for deviation."></point>
            <annotation text="As the IPG said earlier, only the Head Judge can deviate. If the Head Judge does, it must be explained to the players what the standard penalty is, and why the deviation is being made. This does two things. First, it requires the Head Judge to be able to defend their deviation. If you as Head Judge can’t explain it, odds are good you need to re-think your position. Second, the Head Judge should not be teaching players that “this is how it’s done all the time.” The Head Judge is making an exception, this once, and making that clear to the players, and any other judges that might be watching and learning from the interaction."></annotation>
            <point text="Some infractions include remedies to handle the offense beyond the base penalty. These procedures exist to protect officials from accusations of unfairness, bias, or favoritism. If a judge makes a ruling that is consistent with quoted text, then the complaints of a player shift from accusation of unfairness by the judge to accusations of unfair policy. Deviations from these procedures may raise accusations against the judge from the player(s) involved, or from those who hear about it."></point>
            <annotation text="Some penalties come with an additional fix/remedy. These are typically listed after the Philosophy section in their description. Use them; don’t ignore them. They are there to help fix the games as much as is possible. They need to be applied consistently across all events. Not only does it enforce the consistency judges want at the competitive level, it protects them as well. If the judge is following the document, a player can’t (reasonably) claim that the judge is out to get them, or that the judge changed the rules to favor the opponent. When judges deviate, they open themselves up to rumors: “Abe got a downgrade for extra cards in his deckbox, but I didn’t because the judge always lets Abe get away with things.” The short story is: don’t deviate. Don’t end up the subject of some forum rant."></annotation>
            <point text="These procedures do not, and should not, take into account the game being played, the current situation that the game is in, or who will benefit strategically from the procedure associated with a penalty."></point>
            <annotation text="Often judges question this line. When we are called to a table, don’t we have to take into account the current game state? Yes and no. We as judges are allowed to take game state into account when determining if an infraction occurred. It helps us know what questions to ask. For example, if investigating someone for Stalling, then the current match record is extremely important. However, once we determine the infraction, we no longer consider those factors when it comes to applying the fix. When enforcing the additional fix, it doesn’t matter if that fix decides the game or if it allows a player to benefit strategically from an error. Any time there is an error, someone is going to gain some information from it. We do not ask judges to make assessments of exactly what that will be, as this definitely cannot be done with any consistency."></annotation>
            <point text="While it is tempting to try to “fix” game situations, the danger of missing a subtle detail or showing favoritism to a player (even unintentionally) makes it a bad idea."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges should stick to the fixes prescribed. They have been tested thoroughly and tend to work in all but the most extreme of corner cases. By trying to create your own “fix”, you run the risk of not fixing everything properly and giving one player too much of an advantage. This is especially important for judges who are used to FNM, where they are allowed to be more “creative” with their fixes."></annotation>
            <point text="If an error leads to multiple related infractions, only issue one with the most severe penalty."></point>
            <annotation text="This covers the case where judges come up to a table and find multiple errors. In many cases the errors are separate; like doing a deck check and finding marked cards and a 59 card deck. While those might both be found at the same time, they do not have the same root cause. However, sometimes multiple errors share the same root cause – such as players thinking heroic triggers off abilities, and repeatedly using equipment to trigger heroic. In that case, the root cause is the same, making it one infraction. If they did this three times, treat it as a single infraction for the purposes of fixing it and upgrades."></annotation>
            <annotation text="If the infractions are different infractions, yet have the same root cause, apply all appropriate fixes, despite giving the single infraction. Keep in mind that legally drawing a card off an illegally cast spell is not two infractions."></annotation>

        <point text="1.3. Randomizing a Library">
            <point text="The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the randomized portion of the library."></point>
            <annotation text="Some infractions in the IPG instruct to shuffle or randomize a library as part of the fix. If they do, use these instructions."></annotation>
            <point text="This requires first determining whether any portion of the library is non-random, such as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. Check with both players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for library manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic."></point>
            <annotation text="When instructed to randomize the library, we don’t want to lose parts of the library that have been seen and intentionally ordered. Be sure to ask the players if any cards are known, but given player memory is not always perfect, check all the zones for cards and effects that might have ordered or unordered (like fetch lands) parts of the library."></annotation>
            <point text="Once the library has been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations."></point>
            <annotation text="Separate the cards that are known, keeping the cards face down and hidden and have the players shuffle the part that is unknown, then add the known cards back to where they are supposed to be."></annotation>

            <annotation text="Sorry Cosi’s Trickster. Note that even though this sentence says “performed by a judge” it’s not recommended for a judge to shuffle the library if an infraction calls for the library to be shuffled. Let the player shuffle and present."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.4. Backing Up">
            <point text="Some infractions in this document permit the judge to consider the possibility of a backup."></point>
            <annotation text="These infractions are IPG 2.5 Game Rule Violation, IPG 2.3 Hidden Card Error, and IPG 3.7 Communication Policy Violation."></annotation>
            <point text="Due to the amount of information that may become available to players and might affect their play, backups are regarded as a solution of last resort, only applied in situations where leaving the game in the current state is a substantially worse solution."></point>
            <annotation text="A whole article could be written on this topic, and fortunately, one has been. In short, don’t be quick to backup. You need to take into consideration what actions the players have taken since, what information has been revealed, and the possibility of making things worse. We don’t always have to backup. It’s not “backup if you can, else leave everything alone” it’s “leave things alone unless it’s really really worse than backing up.” Remember, both players are responsible for the game state. No matter how messed up things have gotten, both players had opportunities to prevent it."></annotation>
            <point text="A good backup will result in a situation where the gained information makes no difference and the line of play remains the same (excepting the error, which has been fixed). This means limiting backups to situations with minimal decision trees."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a nice way of saying that the backup was minimally impactful. For example, the active player casts Terror on a White Knight, and the White Knight is put in the graveyard. In this case a rewind is quick and clean and doesn’t impact any decisions. But now let’s add to the scenario. Let’s say the active player cast the Terror to remove a blocker and then attacked with their entire team. In this case more decisions have been made. A rewind may be acceptable, but it may alter the attack. Finally, the active player cast Terror on the Knight, attacked. The opponent blocked. Combat tricks were used on both sides. In this case, too much information has been revealed. Backing up to the point of error would drastically impact the flow of the turn. The fewer decisions, the more likely a rewind is acceptable."></annotation>
            <point text="Only the Head Judge may authorize a backup. At large tournaments, they may choose to delegate this responsibility to Team Leaders."></point>
            <annotation text="This shouldn’t come as a surprise. Any time you are about to do something that cannot be easily reversed (such as an erroneous Game Loss, or a mangled rewind) the Head Judge must be consulted first. At big events, such as a Grand Prix or StarCityGames Opens, the Head Judge may allow Team Leaders to authorize backups. If this is the case, this will be communicated during the judge meeting. Now, this does not mean that if you feel a backup is a good idea, you can’t request a backup from the Head Judge."></annotation>
            <point text="To perform a backup, each individual action since the point of the error is reversed, starting with the most recent ones and working backwards. Every action must be reversed; no parts of the sequence should be omitted or reordered."></point>
            <annotation text="Ask the players what happened. You should have a clear understanding of each action that needs to be reversed before you start doing a backup. There should be no “I’m not sure what lands were tapped” or “I don’t remember if he attacked with that creature or tapped to use its ability.” Undo each action, in order. You don’t get to skip anything or switch stuff around. You must return exactly to the point of error, exactly the way it happened. This is to protect you as much as the players. If you rewind everything in reverse order, the players can see and understand what is going on."></annotation>
            <point text="If the identity of a card involved in reversing an action is unknown to one of the players (usually because it was drawn), a random card is chosen from the possible candidates."></point>
            <annotation text="Rewinding through a card draw can make people nervous. It’s really not that complicated, but still shouldn’t be done lightly. If backing up through a card draw, put the card back where it came from. If the specific card isn’t known to all players, put a random one back. Now, as a point of clarity, if you find yourself wanting to shuffle after returning a random card from a player’s hand as part of a rewind, you are probably doing more harm than good at this point with the rewind. Shuffling away a random card from a player’s hand is pretty much the definition of “disruptive”, but we will see below we can get around that."></annotation>
            <point text="Actions that caused a player to learn the identity of cards at a specific location in the library are reversed by shuffling those cards into the random portion of the library unless they were subsequently drawn; cards being returned to the library as part of the backup should not be shuffled at that stage if their identity was known to only one player."></point>
            <annotation text="If we are rewinding through an action that resulted in information about card location in the library becoming known (like scrying), we randomize the portion of the library that information was contained in (in plain language, we shuffle the previously random portion of the library, including the card(s) that became known). If we are rewinding through a drawn card, however, we don’t want to enable that card or another to be shuffled away, and so… it’s not. We simply return a random card from the hand to the top of the library."></annotation>
            <point text="Backups involving random/unknown elements should be approached with extreme caution, especially if they cause or threaten to cause a situation in which a player will end up with different cards than they would once they have correctly drawn those cards. For example, returning cards to the library when a player has the ability to shuffle their library is not something that should be done except in extreme situations."></point>
            <annotation text="So, any time you are messing around with returning random cards from a player’s hand you run the risk of drastically changing the game. For example, the player has been holding on to a specific card since his opening draw. In a rewind, that card gets randomly put on top of the library. Then when we proceed forward, the opponent mills a card. Or we return a useless card to the top of the library, and they crack a fetch land to shuffle it away."></annotation>
            <point text="Some remedies state a simple backup may be performed. A simple backup is backing up the last action completed (or one currently in progress) and is sometimes used to make another portion of the prescribed remedy smoother."></point>
            <annotation text="Game Rule Violation and Hidden Card Error mentions that a simple backup may be done before applying a partial fix if it makes sense. This describes what a small backup is. Small backups are limited to one action, and exist just to make other fixes have intuitive results."></annotation>
            <point text="A simple backup should not involve any random elements."></point>
            <annotation text="If you are backing up through a shuffle or returning random cards from the hand to the library or anything of the sort, we are no longer in the realm of “simple”. Stop."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="1.5. Sets">
            <point text="Some infractions in this document refer to “sets” of cards."></point>
            <annotation text="These infractions are IPG 2.2 Looking at Extra Cards, IPG 2.3 Hidden Card Error, and IPG 3.5 Deck Problem."></annotation>
            <point text="A set is a physically distinct group of cards defined by a game rule or effect. It may correspond to a specific zone, or may only represent a part of a zone. A set may consist of a single card."></point>
            <annotation text="A card or rule may create sets briefly during their resolution (such as Fact or Fiction, Collected Company, or even your draw for turn). If you are holding one or more cards, that’s a set.  If you flipped over the top 3 cards of your library to reveal them, that’s a set.  Other sets simply exist naturally in the game, such as your Library, Graveyard, Exile, and Hand. Just to be as clear as possible, it is also directly spelled out that a single card may be a set."></annotation>
            <point text="Cards are considered to be part of a set until they join another set. There is no in-between state and any card that has not yet been seen is part of the previous set (unless the new set is hidden)."></point>
            <annotation text="This is just explicitly clear language to ensure that, no matter how hard you try, there will not exist a card without it being part of a set. Consider any unseen card as a part of the previuous non-hidden set."></annotation>

        <point text="2.1. Missed Trigger">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="No Penalty"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A triggered ability triggers, but the player controlling the ability doesn’t demonstrate awareness of the trigger’s existence by the first time that it would affect the game in a visible fashion."></point>
            <annotation text="To quote the Comprehensive Rules: 603.1 Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger condition], [effect],” and begin with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” They can also be expressed as “[When/Whenever/At] [trigger event], [effect].” A triggered ability is said to “trigger” whenever the above-mentioned [trigger condition] has been met."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Generally speaking, the point at which a player needs to demonstrate awareness of a triggered ability is after it has triggered, but no later than when that ability would “first matter.” The finer details of when things “first matter” will be covered throughout this definition."></annotation>
            <point text="The point by which the player needs to demonstrate this awareness depends on the impact that the trigger would have on the game:"></point>
            <annotation text="This is another way of saying that in order to figure out whether or not a player has missed a trigger, you must first consider what the ability does. The point at which the ability first matters depends on which of the below four categories that ability belongs to. Note that this is intended to be an exhaustive list — all triggered abilities in the game may be categorized in one of the following ways."></annotation>
			<point text="- A triggered ability that requires its controller to choose targets (other than 'target opponent'), modes, or other choices made when the ability is put onto the stack: The controller must announce those choices before they next pass priority."></point>
            <annotation text="These are triggered abilities that first matter as they are put onto the stack. In order to avoid missing these triggers, the controller of these abilities must remember to make the choices involved with these right away."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For the purposes of triggered abilities, the choice of a “target opponent” is automatically assumed in a two-player game. The controller is not required to explicitly make this choice to avoid missing the trigger. A player isn’t off the hook just yet, though — they will still need to demonstrate awareness at some later point according to whichever of the three remaining groups the effect fits into. Also, the opponent is not assumed to be the target when the trigger requires a “target player,” even if it’s “obvious” that you want to target the opponent."></annotation>
            <point text="- A triggered ability that causes a change in the visible game state (including life totals) or requires a choice upon resolution: The controller must take the appropriate physical action or acknowledge the specific trigger before taking any game actions (such as casting a sorcery spell or explicitly taking an action in the next step or phase) that can be taken only after the triggered ability should have resolved."></point>
            <annotation text="These are triggered abilities that first matter at resolution. In order to avoid missing these triggers, the controller of these abilities must remember to make the choice or take the visible action when the trigger would resolve (or prompt the opponent to do so). The player may also avoid missing the trigger by making it clear to the opponent what outcome will be taken when the trigger resolves."></annotation>
            <annotation text="As it turns out, this is by far the most common type of triggered ability in the game. Most triggered abilities involve obvious visible actions such as drawing cards, moving objects from zone to zone, or modifying the state of permanents. Note that life totals are considered part of the visible representation of the game — this implies that triggered abilities that cause a player to take damage or gain life first matter at the point that a score pad should be updated."></annotation>
            <point text="Note that passing priority, casting an instant spell or activating an ability doesn’t mean a triggered ability has been forgotten, as it could still be on the stack."></point>
            <annotation text="When making this determination, a lot of benefit of the doubt is given to players — they usually have to go well out of their way to show that they’ve missed a trigger. For example, if a player casts a spell during upkeep, it is assumed that upkeep triggers are still on the stack, not missed."></annotation>
            <point text="- A triggered ability that changes the rules of the game: The controller must acknowledge the trigger or stop an opponent who tries to take any resulting illegal action."></point>
            <annotation text="These are triggered abilities that first matter at the point at which an opponent tries to take an illegal action due to the trigger. In order to avoid missing these triggers, the controller of these abilities must announce the trigger at the correct time and/or actively prevent an opponent from taking an action that wouldn’t be possible had the triggered ability resolved."></annotation>
			<annotation text="If an opponent hasn’t acknowledged the trigger then players are welcome to behave as if it was forgotten, but they must expect to be stopped by that opponent."></annotation>
			<annotation text="For example, suppose after cycling a card Alex attacks Nat with a Cunning Survivor and doesn’t immediately mention their trigger. Nat is allowed to animate a Mutavault and try to declare it alone as a blocker. If Alex does not speak up about this blocking assignment being illegal before taking a later action or continuing with combat, Alex has missed their trigger.If a player chooses to perform this “Missed Trigger gambit,” so to speak, they risk giving away information like the identity of cards in their hand or intended plays. Worse yet, a player banking on a forgotten trigger of this type may lock themself into a play they would otherwise not want to take.In the above example, if Alex prevents Nat from blocking with Mutavault alone, Nat wouldn’t get to undo the activation of Mutavault."></annotation>
            <point text="- A triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways: The controller must make the change known by the first time the change has an effect on the visible game state."></point>
            <annotation text="These are triggered abilities that aren’t immediately visually apparent, but would first matter at some point after resolution. Examples include causing a creature to gain some ability or giving a creature a power and toughness bonus (but not a counter or targeted)The result of these effects may cause some later visible change to the game state. For example, suppose Nat controls an Aether Flash at the time that Alex casts a 3/3 Hill Giant, and neither player mentions the trigger. If, later that turn, Nat deals 1 additional damage to Alex’s creature, Nat will have not missed the Aether Flash trigger if they prompt Alex to put their creature into the graveyard at that time. In this case, Aether Flash’s trigger first matters at the point when Alex’s creature receives lethal damage."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This is something that people get hung up on, and will be addressed in more detail below. But the default assumption of the opponent should be that the trigger happened when it was supposed to."></annotation>
            <point text="Once any of the above obligations has been fulfilled, further problems are treated as a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation."></point>
            <annotation text="As convenient as it may be for judges to consider previously acknowledged but problematically-executed triggered abilities to be missed, they must nonetheless be treated as a different infraction."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For example, suppose Alex attacks Nat with an unblocked Arbor Elf equipped with Sword of Feast and Famine. During the combat damage step, Alex untaps their lands but both players forget about Nat discarding. Even if this is noticed during the post combat main phase, this must be treated as a Game Rules Violation by either rewinding the game or applying the appropriate partial fix, and not by simply asking Nat whether to place the trigger on the stack. It is also a Game Rules Violation if you acknowledge a trigger at the proper time or earlier, and then, because of multiple things on the stack, you forget to resolve it."></annotation>
            <point text="Triggered abilities that do nothing except create delayed triggered abilities automatically resolve without requiring acknowledgment. Awareness of the resulting delayed trigger must be demonstrated at the appropriate point."></point>
            <annotation text="The first sentence implies that it is impossible to miss, for example, Grave Betrayal’s triggered ability. However, the second sentence means that the delayed triggered ability itself, which makes a visible change to the game state, may be missed if not acknowledged by the time it would first matter. If Nat’s creature dies while Alex controls a Grave Betrayal, the trigger happens. However Alex can still miss the resulting delayed trigger by later passing the turn without returning the creature to the battlefield or otherwise calling attention to the ability. This is a concession to the way players play. The delayed triggers creation isn’t “relevant” but its resolution is."></annotation>
            <point text="Triggered abilities that do nothing except create one or more copies of a spell or ability (such as storm or cipher) automatically resolve, but awareness of the resulting objects must be demonstrated using the same requirements as described above (even though the objects may not be triggered abilities)."></point>
            <annotation text="For example, the storm ability of Empty the Warrens is not considered missed even if the spell’s controller does not specifically announce the trigger before passing priority after casting the spell. However, if that player then forgets to put the additional Goblins onto the battlefield before moving on with their turn, the storm trigger would be considered missed. Again, this is a concession to the way players actually play Magic."></annotation>
            <point text="Abilities consisting of an action followed by “when you do” in the same ability are considered communicated by the announcement of the action. This is most commonly the case for exert and similar abilities."></point>
			<annotation text="Announcing the action that makes the trigger ability to trigger is sufficient to demonstrate the awareness of the Reflexive triggers."></annotation>
			<point text="If a triggered ability would have no impact on the game, it’s not an infraction to fail to demonstrate awareness of it."></point>
            <annotation text="There has to be no impact to the game, not that it’s obvious a choice wouldn’t be made. You shouldn’t take into account how likely an opponent is to perform some optional action permitted by the ability. For example, a tapped Desecration Demon should still have its triggered ability acknowledged and the opponent should be prompted for choice of a sacrifice even though Desecration Demon is already tapped."></annotation>
            <point text=" For example, if the effect of a triggered ability instructs its controller to sacrifice a creature, a player who controls no creatures isn’t required to demonstrate awareness of the ability."></point>
            <annotation text="Another example of a triggered ability that would have no impact on the game may occur in a scenario in which a player controls no other creatures and attacks with a Chasm Drake. The Chasm Drake itself is the only legal target for the ability, but giving a Chasm Drake a second instance of flying would be redundant. So, this trigger would not matter and intentionally ignoring it would not be an infraction."></annotation>
            <point text="Similarly, a player demonstrating awareness of an optional trigger with no visible effect is assumed to have made the affirmative choice unless the opponent responds."></point>
            <annotation text="This is the old ‘may’ trigger. If a player points out an optional trigger, and it has no visible effect, when it resolves, it’s assumed that they chose to for the ‘may’ part to happen. However, this assumption only holds unless the opponent responds. If they do, then you have to specify if you did or didn’t choose the ‘may’. This is relevant in formats with Eldrazi Mimic and Dismember."></annotation>
            <point text="Judges do not intervene in a missed trigger situation unless they intend to issue a Warning or have reason to suspect that the controller is intentionally missing their triggered abilities."></point>
            <annotation text="This is another very important detail to keep in mind when observing a match as either a spectator or judge. Simply asking a player if they acknowledged a triggered ability is itself a reminder of that ability. Worse still, calling attention to a particular triggered ability before it would first matter provides an opportunity for a player to acknowledge it then. Depending on the circumstances, making this mistake could be perceived by an opponent as a lack of impartiality or even as significant coaching. Furthermore, if a spectator makes this mistake, it could be considered Tournament Error — Outside Assistance. Clearly, this should be avoided."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The only exception to this, of course, is when a judge needs to issue a Warning or investigate a player for Cheating. The needs of the tournament — specifically, ensuring its integrity — exceed those of an individual match."></annotation>
            <point text="A player controlling another player is responsible for that player’s triggers in addition to their own."></point>
            <annotation text="If one player is controlling another player then the controlling player is responsible for remembering that player’s triggers. There aren’t any differences to this infraction other than the controlling player cannot forget any triggers, theirs or the player’s they are controlling. For the purposes of any fixes below, the controlled player is the opponent."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. Knight of Infamy (a 2/1 creature with exalted) attacks alone. Its controller says “Take two”."></example>
            <annotation text="(Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.) In this scenario, this ability first matters during the combat damage step. This is a triggered ability that affects the game state in non-visible ways.

            <point text="Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when forgetting about one."></point>
            <annotation text="It’s pretty easy to forget triggers, there are a lot of them and there are often no visual components to them. They are also typically beneficial, and the ones that aren’t, the opponent is motivated to be aware of. Furthermore, triggered abilities have sort of a “natural” handling if they’re forgotten — most of the time, they can simply just not happen without any additional cleanup or situation-specific remedy being needed."></annotation>
            <point text="Players are expected to remember their own triggered abilities; intentionally ignoring one may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating (unless the ability would have no impact on the game as described above)."></point>
            <annotation text="So, while forgetting your trigger is not to be harshly penalized, intentionally missing your trigger is much more serious. Note the subtle usage of the word “may,” in the sentence above. If you suspect a player of cheating, read the definition of Cheating to see if it applies. Another exception to this being Unsporting Conduct – Cheating is if the player in question were not aware that intentionally ignoring one’s own triggered abilities is against the rules. It was pointed out that now, with the Pacts, a player can “forget” their trigger and then say “oops I forgot” when the opponent notices; this is a case where an investigation for Cheating can be a good idea."></annotation>
            <point text="Even if an opponent is involved in the announcement or resolution of the ability, the controller is still responsible for ensuring the opponents make the appropriate choices and take the appropriate actions. Opponents are not required to point out triggered abilities that they do not control, though they may do so if they wish."></point>
            <annotation text="Remembering one’s trigger is always the responsibility of the player who controls the ability. This is usually, but not always, the controller of the object that has the ability. It doesn’t matter that the triggered ability may allow an opponent to take an optional action — the controller of the trigger is responsible for remembering it and prompting the opponent to make a choice. Examples include things like Frost Titan, Desecration Demon and Rhystic Study."></annotation>
            <annotation text="One of the many skills tested in Magic is the ability of players to remember their own triggered abilities. Players should not be punished for the inabilities or poor memories of their opponents."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Why might a player want to remind an opponent of their triggered ability? It’s possible that the trigger might benefit themselves more than their opponent or it might inconvenience their opponent so reminding them makes sense."></annotation>
            <point text="Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated, and the impact on the game state may not be immediately apparent."></point>
            <annotation text="Triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered not only by both the player and opponent, but also by any judges watching the match. By failing to acknowledge a triggered ability by when it would first matter, the player effectively disproves this assumption. This sentence also answers the question of “How can I tell if my opponent missed their exalted trigger?”"></annotation>
            <annotation text="You are to assume it happened until you have evidence that it didn’t. This is an important point. Just as you can acknowledge a trigger happened earlier than required, you can also indicate the trigger didn’t happen earlier than required"></annotation>
            <annotation text="For example, if you untap with a Kragma Butcher and say nothing indicating the trigger, it is assumed to be a 4/3. However, the controller can indicate earlier than combat damage that they forgot the trigger. Attacking with an Ensnaring Bridge on the battlefield might indicate its trigger was missed. Answering “what’s that creature’s power?” with “it’s a 2/3” is an indication it was missed."></annotation>
            <point text="The opponent’s benefit is in not having to point out triggered abilities, although this does not mean that they can cause triggers to be missed."></point>
            <annotation text="To repeat an earlier annotation, players are never responsible for remembering their opponent’s triggers. Players are allowed to remain quiet about triggers controlled by an opponent being missed, even if the triggered ability would do something harmful to its controller. There is never a time when a player should be issued an infraction, be it Unsporting Conduct — Cheating, Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State, etc., for either accidentally or intentionally not calling attention to an opponent’s missed trigger. Players do not have to help their opponents beat them; however, they cannot trick their opponents into missing triggers."></annotation>
            <point text=" If an opponent requires information about the precise timing of a triggered ability or needs details about a game object that may be affected by a resolved triggered ability, that player may need to acknowledge that ability’s existence before its controller does."></point>
            <annotation text="Suppose Alex controls Cathedral of War and attacks with a single 2/2 Bear Cub, proceeding through to the declare blockers step without mentioning the triggered ability. After declaring blockers, Nat considers casting Shock targeting the unblocked Bear Cub."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Nat has two options — they could simply cast Shock, targeting the Bear Cub, hoping that Alex forgot about the trigger. However, by doing so, Nat risks Alex acknowledging the trigger by not putting the Bear Cub into the graveyard. In other words, just because Alex didn’t explicitly announce the trigger doesn’t mean they missed it — the point at which the trigger would first matter in this case would be after Shock resolves. So, if Nat were to attempt this ploy, they risk wasting the Shock."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Alternatively, Nat could ask Alex what Bear Cubs current power/toughness is. This is derived information, so Alex isn’t required to answer, but if they do, Nat knows if the trigger is missed or not."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This may seem somewhat unsatisfactory to Nat, since asking questions about the toughness of the Bear Cub will probably remind Alex about the trigger and give them one last opportunity to acknowledge it. However, as the IPG says, “triggered abilities are assumed to be remembered until otherwise indicated.” The policy isn’t designed to let Nat trap Alex, it’s designed to reflect the way players actually play the game."></annotation>
            <point text="A player who makes a play that may or may not be legal depending on whether an opponent’s uncommunicated trigger has been remembered has not committed an infraction; their play either succeeds, confirming that the trigger has been missed, or is rewound."></point>
            <annotation text="It isn’t up to the opponent to confirm whether or not a player has missed their trigger before making a play that may be illegal. For example, if Alex is attacking with Pyreheart Wolf, it is not illegal for Nat to block the wolf with one creature. When that block is proposed, it is up to Alex to indicate the illegality of the block or not, and this will determine if the play needs to be rewound."></annotation>
            <point text="Players may not cause triggered abilities controlled by an opponent to be missed by taking game actions or otherwise prematurely advancing the game"></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence has a lot of philosophical weight, and provides guidance on how to deal with triggered abilities controlled by one player that trigger during another player’s turn. Triggered abilities fitting this description deserve some special consideration. Generally speaking, the active player — that’s the player whose turn it is — controls the flow of the game by taking each turn-based action as they move through that turn’s steps and phases. Magic players rarely explicitly pass priority, most of the time just shortcutting through nearly all of the technical rigmarole."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The reason that policy allows for players to acknowledge triggers just after an opponent takes a game action that would otherwise cause the trigger to be missed is precisely because players do not usually prompt their opponents for actions before moving ahead with their turns. For example, players will often proceed straight from their main phase to declaring attackers without asking the opponent if they want to first do anything — such as announcing any beginning of combat triggers."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The missed trigger policy was written to address the way that players already play the game and not the other way around."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player that says nothing about their opponent’s Braids, Cabal Minion trigger before attempting to draw for the turn hasn’t committed an infraction. If an opponent speaks up about the trigger as soon as the card is drawn, the trigger has not been missed."></annotation>
            <point text="During an opponent’s turn, if a trigger’s controller demonstrates awareness of the trigger before they take an active role (such as taking an action or explicitly passing priority), the trigger is remembered"></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence simply further clarifies what has been stated above. If a player has a trigger that would happen on an opponent’s turn, that player has to actively “miss” it, they can’t be moved past the point of acknowledging the trigger by the active player’s actions in their own turn. It is also to prevent players from trying to use a loophole in the policy to rush past their opponents trigger, so that they can deny their opponent the trigger. This sentence closes the perception of that loophole. You cannot force your opponent to miss their trigger."></annotation>
            <point text="The Out-of-Order Sequencing rules (MTR section 4.3) may also be applicable, especially as they relate to batches of actions or resolving items on the stack in an improper order."></point>
            <annotation text="Due to the complexity of accurately representing a game of Magic, it is acceptable for players to engage in a block of actions that, while technically in an incorrect order, arrive at a legal and clearly understood game state once they are complete."></annotation>
            <annotation text="All actions taken must be legal if they were executed in the correct order, and any opponent can ask the player to do the actions in the correct sequence so that they can respond at the appropriate time (at which point players will not be held to any still-pending actions)."></annotation>
            <annotation text="An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely gaining information which could reasonably affect decisions made later in that sequence."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This means that, in certain situations, players may acknowledge a trigger as part of a block of actions, some of which may technically be later than the point at which the trigger would first matter, without the trigger being missed."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For example, a player may, in quick succession, sacrifice Pitchburn Devils to pay the cost of their Carrion Feeder’s activated ability, then put a counter on the Carrion Feeder, and then say “you take 3,” without Pitchburn Devils’s trigger being considered missed. If the player takes these actions all at once without leaving an opportunity for the opponent to indicate responses or provide additional information, this should usually be ruled a legal out-of-order sequence of actions"></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player could not, however, remove the last counter from a Rift Bolt, then draw for the turn, and then say “I’ll Rift Bolt your creature.” Even if the player performs these actions in quick succession and without the opponent saying anything, they would still have gained the knowledge of the card drawn for the turn before choosing their Rift Bolt target. This should usually be ruled a Missed Trigger."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="If the triggered ability is an enters-the-battlefield trigger of an Aura that affects only the enchanted permanent and causes a visible change to that permanent, resolve the ability immediately."></point>
            <annotation text="Mostly these will be Auras that tap the permanent such as Malfunction, once the missed trigger has been noticed the trigger will be resolved tapping the permanent immediately."></annotation>
            <point text="If the triggered ability is a delayed triggered ability that undoes a zone change (including token creation) caused by the effect that created the delayed triggered ability, the opponent chooses whether to resolve the ability the next time a player would get priority or when a player would get priority at the start of the next phase. The new zone does not need to be the same as the one the card was originally moved from."></point>
            <annotation text="This type of triggered ability, known as delayed zone-change triggers, frequently exist in order to “clean things up.” While this type of trigger includes a lot of delayed sacrifices of tokens (Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker, Thatcher Revolt, Geist of Saint Traft, etc.), it also includes many abilities that are utterly vital to the continued use of the associated object or objects. For example, the delayed triggered abilities that return Aetherling and Obzedat, Ghost Council to the battlefield are included in this category. These triggers are necessary for the creatures’ controllers to be able to continue using them that game.  The opponent chooses whether the trigger occurs “now” (when a player would get priority) or “in a moment” (when a player would get priority at the start of the next phase)"></annotation>
			<annotation text="The timing option here allows for a bit of control over creatures appearing and disappearing from the battlefield mid-combat. Putting the control in the hands of the opponent is acceptable because the opponent isn’t the one who missed their trigger, and this allows the opponent to minimize the impact of the player “suddenly” remembering the trigger.  It does also allow the opponent to notice and wait to point it out even if this is to their advantage."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Resolving a delayed zone-change trigger that returns a creature to the battlefield at the start of the next phase means that if a player notices their own missed trigger during their opponent’s end step, the opponent may choose to have the creature remain exiled until the player’s upkeep. That means this creature will have summoning sickness and won’t be able to attack that turn. Of course, an opponent can still opt to have that creature returned to the battlefield when a player got priority during that end of turn step if they really want to."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Finally, wherever the opponent chooses to place the trigger, it is resolved immediately, without using the stack. This is to prevent responding to these triggers that should have already happened. Notably, the opponent gets to choose the “when,” but not the “if.” One reason for this has to do with the fact that many zone-change triggers are, as pointed out above, utterly vital to the continued use of the associated objects. If an opponent got to choose whether these triggers happened at all, this infraction might be a little too harsh on players who, for example, suddenly find their Aetherling exiled forever just because they forgot to return it last turn. From the previous section: “Triggered abilities are common and invisible, so players should not be harshly penalized when forgetting about one.” So, policy has to have some special consideration here."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Also of interest is that even though these abilities don’t expire, players are still under no obligation to remind the opponent of their existence. A player is perfectly within policy by remaining quiet for several turns despite having noticed that their opponent’s Obzedat, Ghost Council never returned from exile. The final sentence is to make it clear that even though the concept of undoing a zone change implies returning it to the zone it came from it covers delayed triggered abilities that put the card in a completely different zone, Sneak Attack being a good example."></annotation>
			<point text="For all other triggered abilities, if the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing."></point>
            <annotation text="If it’s been more than a turn since the trigger was missed, the ability is skipped with no further resolution. Remember, though, that if that ability were detrimental for the controlling player, they should still receive a penalty no matter how long it’s been."></annotation>
			<point text="If the triggered ability created an effect whose duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing."></point>
            <annotation text="For example, if the missed triggered ability lasts “until [some amount of time]” or “for as long as [some condition],” then the ability has a duration. If a missed trigger is not noticed until after the amount of time has elapsed or the condition is no longer true, the ability is skipped with no further resolution."></annotation>
            <point text="If the triggered ability isn’t covered by the previous paragraphs, the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack."></point>
            <annotation text="So, run through the checks above. If none of them fit, this is our default. The opponent should be explicitly asked if they would like the ability to go on the stack. Judges should not just assume that players won’t want triggers harmful to them or helpful to an opponent to be skipped, no matter how silly asking might seem."></annotation>
            <point text=" If it is, it’s inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack."></point>
            <annotation text="One case in which it might not be possible to insert the trigger in the appropriate place on the stack is if some of the other abilities that triggered at the same time as the missed trigger have since resolved and are no longer there."></annotation>
            <point text="No player may make choices involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered."></point>
            <annotation text="When placing missed triggers on the stack, players may make choices only about objects that could have been chosen had the trigger not been missed. Because there is one-turn expiration on placing missed triggers on the stack, it’s unlikely that many permanents have moved around in the interim. For this reason, remembering which objects were in which zones shouldn’t be too taxing to either player’s memory."></annotation>
            <point text="For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered."></point>
            <annotation text="If a player unintentionally misses their own Smokestack trigger (At the beginning of each player’s upkeep, that player sacrifices a permanent for each soot counter on Smokestack), but this is not noticed until after the player has moved into their first main phase and played a land, the player should receive a Warning and the opponent should be asked if they would like the trigger to go on the stack. If the trigger is placed on the stack, then the player may not choose the land they just played for the turn as one of the permanents to sacrifice."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If the triggered ability is usually considered detrimental for the controlling player and they own the card responsible for the existence of the trigger, the penalty is a Warning."></point>
            <annotation text="“Usually detrimental” triggers are often all-downside triggers that have been added to some card in order to balance out some other above-the-curve stats or other beneficial effects. Other times, “usually detrimental” triggers are ones that “clean up” a game state by causing the controller to sacrifice some temporarily-created tokens or to give a momentarily nullified permanent back to an opponent.."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Furthermore, “usually detrimental” means that you should consider the card associated with the trigger in a vacuum and not take into account any game-specific information in order to determine whether or not a trigger is detrimental. Toby Elliott once said (on his blog) that one guideline for making this determination is to ask yourself: “If the trigger didn’t exist, would the card be played?” If the answer is no, then the ability is probably not detrimental."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The last sentence is added for cards like The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale or Kataki, War’s Wage. They has a mostly-defunct template which creates triggers on other objects, notably opponent objects."></annotation>
            <annotation text="We cleaned up the default action. What about the Warning? How do we make these triggers not detrimental? It turns out there’s an intuitive solution – a trigger is only detrimental for you if you caused its existence. Always take responsibility for your creations!"></annotation>
			<point text="The current game state is not a factor in determining this, though symmetrical abilities (such as Howling Mine) may be considered usually detrimental or not depending on who is being affected."></point>
            <annotation text="When determining if a trigger is ‘usually detrimental,’ we do not look at the game state. A Dark Confidant trigger at 20 life is the same as a Dark Confidant trigger at 1 life. This is because we want consistent rulings and there is no way to take game state into account and have every judge answer the same way."></annotation>
            <annotation text="However, we are allowed to consider symmetrical abilities differently based on who is affected. What exactly is a symmetrical ability? Symmetrical abilities are triggered abilities that meet two conditions. They: 1. are likely to trigger multiple times per game, triggering for different players 2. have the same effect on both players."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Examples include Howling Mine, Sulfuric Vortex, and Burning Earth. A symmetrical ability may either do something positive to both players, or do something negative to both players, but would never do something positive to one player and negative to the other player. Furthermore, a symmetrical ability must have its effect on each player during separate instances of the same ability. For example, Sire of Insanity’s triggered ability (At the beginning of each end step, each player discards their hand.) is not symmetrical."></annotation>
            <annotation text="If a player misses a symmetrical trigger that would be either bad for them or good for an opponent, they should receive a Warning."></annotation>

        <point text="2.2 Looking at Extra Cards">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Warning"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player takes an action that may have enabled them to see the faces of cards that they were not entitled to see."></point>
            <annotation text="This infraction is pretty easy to commit. Any time that a library is touched, it is possible that a card will be dropped, or flipped over; or when drawing a card, two cards may get stuck or picked up together."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Generally, when we are talking about Looking at Extra Cards (L@EC), we are talking about a player seeing the face of some card in his or her own deck. However, you might also see some cards in your opponent’s deck while shuffling it."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Be careful not to confuse this infraction with the Hidden Card Error infraction. In particular, the Hidden Card Error infraction also covers situations where you are looking at some number of cards on the top of your library and you look at too many of them. So, in this specific case, you are looking at extra cards, but you aren’t Looking At Extra Cards.  Does your brain hurt? Mine does."></annotation>
			<annotation text="As mentioned in the section above, HCE touches similar space to the Looking at Extra Cards infraction.  When you are manipulating a set of cards from the top of the library, and you manipulate too many of them, that’s considered HCE. For the purpose of HCE, once the drawn cards have significantly left the library as part of a draw, they can no longer be considered Looking at Extra Cards."></annotation>
			<annotation text="From the explanation released with a recent change to this infraction, it is stated that “the key [to determining the LEC/HCE border] is to look at whether the opponent intended (mistakenly or not) to pick up that many cards, or if they were trying to pick up the correct number and failed to do so thanks to bad dexterity (as opposed to bad counting!)”"></annotation>
			<annotation text="Sets are defined in section 1.5, so head there if you need a refresher. Basically, once the card you are just looking at is added to a set of cards, you aren’t looking at it anymore, and the infraction is no longer LEC but rather HCE. But if you are supposed to Scry 1, and you instead pick up two cards, you didn’t add that second card to the Scry set until you actually start to Scry. Get it? It’s ok if this is a little confusing because this distinction is probably the least clear of anything in this entire guide. Basically, there is a point when picking up those two cards where we transition from “oops, I grabbed a second card” to “I have a second card that I can perform actions on”. Its that point that marks the line between L@EC and HCE in this case."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Looking at Extra Cards also covers when you knock over a card, drop a card while shuffling an opponent’s deck, start to draw a card when you shouldn’t, and milling or dredging too many cards. Milling and Dredging are covered by Looking at Extra Cards because the cards are being placed into a public zone we can all see.  However, this only applies if we catch the error right away. If we start to take other actions, we have moved past the point where we can claim we accidentally saw an extra card, and we have instead accepted that card is supposed to be in the graveyard."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Sometimes players put cards on the table face down before drawing them, for the purpose of counting the cards or for thinking before putting the cards into the hand. This is not forbidden and judges should not penalize it. In this situation the difference is that the player does it intentionally and takes care about not seeing any cards improperly.  This statement also applies to the HCE infraction."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Dropping a card while shuffling your own library is not Looking at Extra Cards. Just put the card back and continue to randomize your deck."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Observing the face of a card your opponent dropped or flipped is also not Looking at Extra Cards. There are two reasons for this: 1) If a player could drop a card and get their opponent a Warning, they are going to messy-shuffle their way into a top 8. 2) MTR 3.12 allows players to reveal hidden information to their opponent that they are entitled to know."></annotation>
			<annotation text="It’s important to note that this infraction only applies to cards in a library (or sideboard).  If you accidentally look at cards exiled by a Bomat Courier, that’s not Looking at Extra Cards- it’s a Game Rule Violation."></annotation>
			<point text="This penalty is applied only once if one or more cards are seen in the same action or sequence of actions."></point>
            <annotation text="We don’t penalize a player for each card seen if all the cards are seen during the same game action or sequence of game actions."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player accidentally reveals (drops, flips over) a card while shuffling their opponent’s library."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player pulls up an extra card while drawing from their library."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player sees the bottom card of their deck when presenting it to their opponent for cutting/shuffling."></example>
            <annotation text="In Example B, please consider ‘pulls’ up, as ‘lifts up, but not so much that it could reasonably be considered separate from the library’."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Other examples could be: A player flips over an extra card while resolving a Cascade ability. A player flips over extra cards when milling their deck, and this is noticed immediately."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="A player can accidentally look at extra cards easily and this infraction handles situations where a dexterity or rules error has led to a player seeing cards that they shouldn’t have."></point>
            <annotation text="Players touch their decks a lot. They touch to shuffle, they touch to draw, they touch to search. And every time a deck is touched, there is the possibility that you are going to see something you shouldn’t. Since it is easy to do, easy to notice, and easy to fix, a Warning is the appropriate penalty."></annotation>
            <point text="Cards in a library are considered to be there until they touch cards in another hidden set. Once those cards have joined another hidden set, the infraction is handled as a Hidden Card Error or Game Rule Violation."></point>
            <annotation text="We all know that drawing is different from looking but sometimes the line is not easy to see. The line here is when the card we are looking at is added to another set of cards, either the hand, or seven other cards from dig through time.  Keep in mind that for this infraction, we do allow you to use your judgement a bit when it comes to “I meant to pick up one card and instead I picked up two.” That’s not “adding to a set” just yet."></annotation>
            <point text="Players should not use this penalty to get a “free shuffle” or to attempt to shuffle away cards they don’t want to draw; doing so may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating."></point>
            <annotation text="This point involves judge ability to understand if a player is lying. Some players know that the additional fix for Looking at Extra Cards is a shuffle, so they might “accidentally” peek at a card in order to try to get a shuffle. This is cheating, and helps to emphasize the point that we need to determine if there are any known cards before we apply the additional fix. When you arrive at the table ask both players some questions to get a sense of what is really happening."></annotation>
            <point text="Players should not use this penalty to get a “free shuffle” or to attempt to shuffle away cards they don’t want to draw; doing so may be Unsporting Conduct — Cheating."></point>

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player commits an error in the game that cannot be corrected by only publicly available information."></point>
            <annotation text="Most Game Play Errors can be observed by both players. The window might be small, but it’s visible. Failing to discard a card, casting a spell for the wrong mana; these are things you can see. All the information is out in the open. This isn’t an infraction for those type of errors. This is for when an error occurs and at the point of the error, the opponent has lost the ability to detect how things went wrong, and has no insight into how to fix the game."></annotation>
            <point text="It is not a Hidden Card Error if the opponent acknowledges the action or controls the continuous effect modifying the game rule that made the action illegal"></point>
			<annotation text="This sentence has two parts that involve the opponent. If the opponent acknowledges the draw, the player has given warning that something is about to go wrong. In a very real sense, this error was correctable with publicly available information. In this case, we do not want to overly penalize the player as the error was ‘visible’ to both players, or incentivize the opponent to “agree” to an action that will get their opponent a harsher penalty. The second part involves continuous effects the opponent controls. This is essentially a clause for Narset, Parter of Veils. Here we want to put a bit more of a burden on the owner of the effect to be proactive in preventing problems. Keeping your mouth shut and then getting a free Thoughtseize is too good, and makes these effects a bit strong by allowing the player to play the IPG instead of Magic: The Gathering."></annotation>
            <annotation text="In both cases, consider a Game Rule Violation instead, and for the second case, double GRV is probably appropriate."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Note that if the action would be illegal without the opponent’s continuous effect then it should still be treated as a Hidden Card Error. For example if instructed to scry a player draws a card instead, it is still a Hidden Card Error even if an opponent controls a Narset."></annotation>
			<point text=" This infraction only applies when a card whose identity is known to only one player is in a hidden set of cards both before and after the error."></point>
            <annotation text="In this case, hidden locations are the hand, the library, face down cards on the battlefield and face down cards in exile. Unknown cards are when one or more of the players don’t know what the cards are. Note that the identity of the top card of the library is unknown, but the location of the top card is public, something that isn’t always obvious, so a tutor effect that searches for a specific card and puts it on top of the library is putting the card into a “known” position."></annotation>
            <point text="If an additional card is seen but not added to the set, the infraction is Game Play Error — Looking at Extra Cards."></point>
            <annotation text="This line is here to give a distinction between when a player action should be considered Hidden Card Error versus GPE – Looking at Extra Cards."></annotation>
			<annotation text="If we use Dig Through Time as an example, if a player resolving this spell looks at eight cards rather than seven, we have the wrong number in the set. This is HCE, as the set contains a card it should not, and that set is hidden. If, however, during the resolution of Dig Through Time, a player looks at seven cards, but knocks the eighth card off the deck while picking up those seven, then that eighth card is not a part of the set, and should be treated as a GPE – Looking at Extra Cards infraction."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Adicionalmente, si se va a resolver una habilidad de Adivina 1 y accidentalmente se toman dos cartas, potencialmente se ha cometido Mirar Cartas Adicionales. Esto requiere un poco de sentido común, ya que definir una línea técnica exacta entre Mirar Cartas Adicionales y Error de Carta Oculta requeriría mucho texto y ejemplo y aún así no cubriría todos los casos. Dedica un momento a considerar si Mirar Cartas Adicionales sería la infracción más apropiada, si el jugador erró en el número de cartas o fue un accidente, y si el jugador ha empezado a tomar decisiones sobre ese grupo de cartas."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player draws four cards after casting Ancestral Recall."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player scries two cards when they should only have scried one."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player resolves a Dark Confidant trigger, but forgets to reveal the card before putting it into their hand."></example>
            <example text="- D. A player has more cards in their hand than can be accounted for."></example>
            <example text="- E. A player casts Anticipate and picks up the top four cards of their library."></example>
            <example text="- F. A player, going first, draws for their turn."></example>
            <annotation text="Some of these examples look like the infraction Looking at Extra Cards. The important distinction is that if a player ends up with more cards than they are supposed to, either in their hand, or in a set of cards they are performing an action on, then it falls under the Hidden Card Error infraction. If they’ve only seen one or more extra cards because the card has been flipped over or some other dexterity issue that reveals a card to the player then treat the infraction as Looking at Extra Cards."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Example C only applies if the player remembers the Dark Confidant trigger and doesn’t reveal the card before putting the card into their hand. If the player draws for the turn before remembering, it’s treated as a missed trigger."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Example F looks a lot like it might fall under Mulligan Procedure Error, but it doesn’t because the error occurs after the game has begun. Drawing a card on the opening turn while on the play is an example of adding a card that should not be added to a hidden zone, and thus falls under Hidden Card Error."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Though the game state cannot be reversed to the ‘correct’ state, this error can be mitigated by giving the opponent sufficient knowledge and ability to offset the error so that it is less likely to generate advantage."></point>
            <annotation text="The player with the extra cards has gained information, and that information has been potentially commingled with other cards. Being able to see other information you aren’t supposed to and potentially make decisions or take action on the information or use those resources (cards) is a big deal. We can’t fix it. But we can mitigate it. Your opponent couldn’t witness the error, but by allowing the opponent to participate in the fix, we eliminate any advantage gained from the error, and still provide a strong incentive not to attempt to cheat."></annotation>
            <point text="If cards are placed into a public zone, then their order is known and the infraction can be handled as a Game Rule Violation."></point>
            <annotation text="If cards are revealed for something like a mill effect, where both players can see what’s happening, the infraction isn’t Hidden Card Error, because the cards aren’t hidden. For a mill effect, order is not lost. The information is revealed to everyone and order is maintained. Sounds like all players have all the knowledge, and the judge doesn’t have to worry about one player having information the other doesn’t. In this case, go to the Game Rule Violation infraction."></annotation>
            <point text=" Order cannot be determined from card faces only visible to one player unless the card is in a uniquely identifiable position (such as on top of the library, or as the only card in hand)."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence is in here to prevent arguments about which card was the extra card drawn, or what the third card picked up on a scry 2 was. Unless it was visible to both players, you have to treat the cards like they were mixed up. Note, this is different from some cases of Looking at Extra Cards, where the cards are still being separated from the library where there is a clear order. The line between Looking at Extra Cards and Hidden Card Error is when the cards leave the library and the card faces are only visible to one player."></annotation>
            <point text="Be careful not to apply this infraction in situations where a publicly-correctable error subsequently leads to an uncorrectable situation such as a Brainstorm cast using green mana. In these situations, the infraction is based on that root cause."></point>
            <annotation text="Look at the root cause. Just because we are now in a spot where information has been lost doesn’t mean we started out this way. Another example would be the case of casting Elvish Visionary for UU, and then the player draws a card when the enters the battlefield trigger resolves. Once that card is drawn, that information is lost, but the original problem was the casting of the spell incorrectly and visible to both players."></annotation>
            <point text="Information about cards previously known by the opponent, such as cards previously revealed while on the top of the library or by a previous look at the hand, may be taken into account while determining the set of cards to which the remedy applies."></point>
            <annotation text="Even though the contents of a previously revealed hand are not public information, the knowledge of those cards, when agreed upon by both players (such as from notes taken about the hand) may be useful in reconstructing as correct a game state as possible. There is a “may” here, however. If there is doubt or disagreement about what has been revealed some turns back, and you aren’t confident that the set is correct, you may treat the entire set as the grouping to which to apply the remedy."></annotation>
            <point text="Always operate on the smallest set possible to remedy the error. This may mean applying the remedy to only part of a set defined by an instruction. For example, if a player resolves Collected Company, picks up three cards with one hand and then four cards with the other, the last drawn set of four cards should be used for the remedy, instead of the full set of seven cards."></point>
            <annotation text="This section really just enforces that we use common sense to restore the game without too much disruption. In the example given, the player should have looked at six cards on resolution, but looked at seven. Because of the physical way that action was performed, however, it is clear that the first three cards were correct and maintained a clear distance from the other, physically distinct set of four cards. This allows us to apply the fix to that smaller set (four cards versus seven) without advantage gained or lost unduly. Be sure to gain a full understanding of the actions taken with the cards in question before determining if a smaller set will be appropriate (ensure sets didn’t touch or mingle)."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="In cases where the infraction was immediately followed by moving a card from the affected set to a known location, such as by discarding, putting cards on top of the library, or playing a land, a simple backup to the point just after the error may be performed."></point>
            <annotation text="This portion of the remedy exists so that the actions taken to mitigate advantage may be applied to all of the cards that should have been involved. A simple backup allows for the set of affected cards to be reconstructed in order for the game to be restored as fairly as possible. This type of action is most likely to arise when a player mistakenly puts too many cards directly into their hand, then makes a play or completes some other action before realizing the error has occurred. In this case, consider the benefits of that simple backup before applying the remedy, so that the card set is as correct as possible. This is not a backup to before the error, though, so make sure it is used to restore the set for which the remedy of Hidden Card Error is applied, not to backup to before the Hidden Card Error happened."></annotation>
			<annotation text="An example of this would be if someone draws 4 cards from a Brainstorm, puts 2 cards on top of their library, then the error is detected. We will return those two cards to the hand before applying any other fix."></annotation>
            <point text="If the set of cards that contained the problem no longer exists, there is no remedy to be applied."></point>
            <annotation text="If, during a series of game actions, the affected set of cards has been lost by shuffling them away, and the set cannot reasonably be reconstructed, then there is no set left to which we can apply the remedy. The infraction still exists in this case, and a penalty issued."></annotation>
            <point text="If the error put cards into a set prematurely and other operations involving cards in the set should have been performed first, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previously-unknown cards. Put those cards aside until the point at which they should have been legally added, then return them to the set."></point>
            <annotation text="This is really saying that you can address a complicated situation such as that of “looting” instead of “rummaging.” If a card gave an instruction such as ‘discard a card: draw a card,’ but the player resolves ‘draw a card, then discard a card,’ then we have this remedy available, since the hand now contains a card that shouldn’t be there, but a discard still needs to occur. Since one route to advantage here is the ability to discard the card just drawn, we allow the opponent to identify the card “to be drawn,” and set it aside before applying the remedy. Then, once the remedy has been applied, we return the card to the hand/set, and continue from there."></annotation>
            <point text="If the error involves one or more cards that were supposed to be revealed, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the unrevealed cards and their opponent chooses that many previouslyunknown cards. Treat those as the cards that were ‘revealed’ and return them to the set that was being selected from; the player then reperforms the action. If recreating the original selection set and reperforming the action would be too disruptive, leave the selected cards in hand."></point>
            <annotation text="This involve cards put into a hidden zone whose characteristics should have been checked before they moved to that zone. An example of this is Domri Rade’s first ability, which reads “+1: Look at the top card of your library. If it’s a creature card, you may reveal it and put it into your hand.” If the card is put into the hand without being revealed, we can remedy that by revealing the set with the unrevealed card (this case, the hand) and allowing the opponent to choose which card should be treated as the “revealed card(s)”. Then, the player reperforms the action (the Domri Rade’s 1 ability in our example). If, for instance, the opponent chooses a non-creature card in the Domri Rade example, that card no longer fits legally in the set (the hand) and should be returned to the top of the library."></annotation>
            <point text="If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed to contain, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent chooses a number of previouslyunknown cards sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are returned to the correct location. If that location is the library, they should be shuffled into the random portion unless the owner previously knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, chosen by the opponent, are returned to the original location instead. For example, if a player playing with Sphinx of Jwar Isle illegally draws a card, that card should be returned to the top of the library."></point>
            <annotation text="This is the commonly termed “Thoughtseize” fix. The player with too many cards in the set reveals that set to the opponent, and they choose which card is to be the “excess card(s).” This allows the game to continue while offsetting the very large advantage of an extra card or cards being in hand or another set. Return the excess cards to the location they came from. If that location is the library, we typically do this by shuffling them into the random portion. If the cards were previously known from the top of the library before adding to a set, we return them to the top of the library instead.  This exists to remove a minor cheating angle where a player would attempt to use HCE to get a free shuffle if their hand and top of library were bad."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If a face-down card cast using a morph ability is discovered during the game to not have a morph ability, the penalty is a Game Loss. If the player has one or more cards with a morph ability in hand, has not added previously unknown cards to their hand since casting the card found in violation, and has discovered the error themselves, the upgrade does not apply and they may swap the card for a card with the morph ability in hand."></point>
            <annotation text="In all but a very few cases, Magic is set up so that both players can see what is going on. Both players are responsible for the game. If you pay the wrong mana for a spell, I can see that. If you put too many counters on a creature, I can also see that. When it comes to accidentally casting a card as though it had the morph ability, the opponent cannot verify that the face down card has morph. For example, playing a Highland Game thinking it is a Temur Charger fits this upgrade path."></annotation>
            <annotation text="We also now have a specific option to ignore this upgrade if the player discovers it themselves and hasn’t had any opportunity to add cards to their hand since casting the card. If these conditions are met, rather than upgrading to a game loss, we issue the normal warning and swap the 2 cards."></annotation>

If you cannot apply a simple backup or a partial fix  you evaluate if you need to do a back up or leave alone. If the error fits more than one of these categories, it’s ok to partial fix, but be careful that the error only fits into those categories. If there are multiple fixes within the same bullet point, you’re still fine to use that partial fix."></annotation>
            <point text="- If a player forgot to untap one or more permanents at the start of their turn and it is still the same turn, untap them."></point>
            <annotation text="Out-of-Order-Sequencing has always been a viable option when this type of situation arises, and it does so with some regularity. Players get excited, or simply lose focus and forget to untap everything before advancing into the turn. If that happens, we simply issue the warning and fix the mistake, by untapping those permanents now."></annotation>
            <point text="- If a player made an illegal choice (including no choice where required) for a static ability generating a continuous effect still on the battlefield, that player makes a legal choice."></point>
            <annotation text="This partial fix refers to cards such as True-Name Nemesis, Voice of All or a Siege from Fate Reforged™, which require the choice of a player or color as they enter the battlefield. The reasoning for this is similar to why we apply state-based actions — it is impossible for these cards to exist on the battlefield without a choice being made for them, so we correct that immediately. While this could lead to the perception of advantage for one player, such errors always occur publicly, so it is in both player’s interest to be attentive."></annotation>
            <annotation text="So, if Nick casts Doom Blade on Albert’s Voice of All, we can have Albert chose a color now. If Albert chooses Black, Doom Blade is now illegal. Then, we can do a simple backup to just before Doom Blade was cast."></annotation>

            <annotation text="There is a lot going on in this sentence, so let’s deconstruct it."></annotation>
            <annotation text="– “Object in the incorrect zone due to a required zone change being missed”: This is for where a creature was supposed to die and didn’t, or a card was supposed to be milled and didn’t, Or a creature that is supposed to be bounced and isn’t."></annotation>
            <annotation text="– “or due to being put into the wrong zone during a zone change”: Most commonly this is when a card is supposed to be put in the graveyard, but is put in exile, or vice versa."></annotation>
            <annotation text="– “the identity of the object was known to all players”: This means that all players know what the object is. This could be because the card was revealed or it could be because the card is in a location known by both players such as the top of a library."></annotation>
            <annotation text="– “and it can be moved with only minor disruption to the current game state”: Things disappearing from the battlefield mid-combat tends to be disruptive. Be sure to look at what decisions and actions are currently being made based on that card being on the battlefield. Additionally, this partial fix does not include fixing things that shouldn’t have moved but did. For example, a 4/4 with 3 damage is put into the graveyard, and later discovered that it shouldn’t have been. This partial fix does not include returning it to the battlefield."></annotation>
            <point text="- If damage assignment order has not been declared, the appropriate player chooses that order."></point>
            <annotation text="This is seldom relevant. Most times, when there are multiple blockers, it’s clear what the intent is, and there is no real interaction. However, it can become relevant, and we now have this partial fix. Ned may get upset that Abe gets to declare blocking order in the middle of resolving spells; when it suddenly becomes relevant, however, most of the time it becomes relevant as a result of Ned casting a spell. If Ned is doing something that makes blocking order relevant, they cannot assume that whatever blocking order favors him the most is the correct one. They have the responsibility to clarify the ambiguity prior to it becoming relevant."></annotation>
            <point text="For each of these fixes, a simple backup may be performed beforehand if it makes applying the fix smoother. Triggered abilities are generated from these partial fixes only if they would have occurred had the action been taken at the correct time."></point>
            <annotation text="A simple backup is backing up the last action completed (or one currently in progress) and is sometimes used to make another portion of the prescribed remedy smoother. A simple backup should not involve any random elements. Also while applying a partial fix consider the triggered abilities if they would have occurred while taking the action at the correct time."></annotation>
            <point text="Otherwise, a full backup may be considered or the game state may be left as is."></point>
            <annotation text="So, we look to see if any of the partial fixes apply, and if not, we either rewind or don’t. Please see 1.4 Backing Up for information on if it’s appropriate to back up."></annotation>
            <point text="If the game has proceeded past a point where an opponent could reasonably be expected to notice the error, the opponent has also committed an infraction. In most cases, the infraction is Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State."></point>
            <annotation text="This is simply the definition of Game Play Error – Failure to Maintain Game State, and goes back to the concept that keeping the game in a legal and clear state is both players responsibility."></annotation>
            <point text="However, if the judge believes that both players were responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponent controlling the continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a player taking action based on another player’s instruction, they have instead committed a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, once the game has continued both players will have committed a Game Rule Violation."></point>
            <annotation text="As always, both players are responsible for maintaining a clear game state. If my card tells you to take an action, and you do it incorrectly, whose fault is it? Yours for doing the action incorrectly, or mine for not making sure my spell resolved correctly? Turns out, in this case, it’s reasonable to say we are both equally at fault. Fundamentally if the judge thinks that both players share the responsibility for the error, because of continuous effects or both participating in the action, then both players receive this penalty."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Note that this double GRV only applies *after* the game has moved on from the point of the error. If, in the example above, one player puts the creature into the graveyard, it’s not a double GRV until the game continues on. Instead, if one player points out the error, play can continue on with the error corrected and no infraction assessed."></annotation>

        <point text="2.6 Failure to Maintain Game State">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Warning"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player allows another player in the game to commit a Game Play Error and does not point it out immediately."></point>
            <annotation text="There are actually several things going on here. The first is that a player committing a Game Play Error can never earn Failure to Maintain Game State. The only person that can get Failure to Maintain Game State is the opponent. A player earns Failure to Maintain Game State when they do not catch an error made by the opponent. Also note that if a player points out the opponent’s error right away, they do not earn this infraction. For example, if Abe casts Wrath of God for RRRW and Ned notices before any further actions are taken, Ned will not receive Failure to Maintain Game State."></annotation>
            <point text="If a judge believes a player is intentionally not pointing out other players’ illegal actions, either for their own advantage, or in the hope of bringing it up at a more strategically advantageous time, they should consider an Unsporting Conduct — Cheating infraction."></point>
            <annotation text="Generally we think of Cheating as actively and intentionally doing something against the rules and for an advantage. However, it may also also be Cheating to notice your opponent doing something against the rules and not call a judge, or to only call a judge when it is to your advantage. For example, Abe controls a Juggernaut and forgets to attack with it. Ned says nothing, because he doesn’t want to take the damage. Depending on Ned’s knowledge of game rules and player responsibilities, this may be Cheating."></annotation>
            <point text="Not reminding an opponent about their triggered abilities is never Failure to Maintain Game State nor Cheating."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a very important exception to the “you must point out your opponent’s errors” rule. Missed triggers are handled differently. A player is allowed to not point out their opponent’s missed triggers. Since it is allowed, it cannot be an infraction. See the Missed Trigger section for more details."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player’s opponent forgets to reveal the card searched for by Worldly Tutor. It is not noticed until the end of turn."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player does not notice that their opponent has Armadillo Cloak on a creature with protection from green."></example>
            <annotation text="In both of these cases, the player’s opponent committed a Game Rule Violation, and the player didn’t notice it right away."></annotation>
			<title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="If an error is caught before a player could gain advantage, then the dangers of the ongoing game state becoming corrupted are much lower."></point>
            <annotation text="This is really just a fancy way of saying “the sooner an error is caught, the less likely it is to cause a large problem.” It should be a fairly obvious statement."></annotation>
            <point text="If the error is allowed to persist, at least some of the fault lies with the opponent, who has also failed to notice the error."></point>
            <annotation text="The key point here is that both players are responsible for the game state. If the opponent is being observant, they can help catch a player’s error before the problem becomes more severe. It doesn’t matter who gained an advantage from it. Note that there are some situations where one player controls the effect, and the other player takes the action, but did so in a way that caused an error. In this case, please refer to the Game Rule Violation section, as there are some cases where both players have committed the same infraction."></annotation>
        </point>
        <point text="Game Play Errors are caused by incorrect or inaccurate play of the game such that it results in violations of the Magic Comprehensive Rules."></point>
        <annotation text="This is the first of three broad categories of infractions. This covers unintentional violations of the Comprehensive Rules — errors in actually playing the game, and not violations of tournament policy or other negative behavior."></annotation>
        <annotation text="These are errors committed by at least one player during a match by unintentionally violating a Comprehensive Rule. Game Play Errors can occur for many reasons. Players get tired, get distracted, play too fast, or don’t know the cards or the rules that apply to a complex situation well enough. These situations are not exceptional, which is why Game Play Errors are a common category of error."></annotation>
        <point text="Many offenses fit into this category and it would be impossible to list them all."></point>
        <annotation text="Given the complexity of the game, it is impossible to make a list of all the types of errors that can occur, so we, as judges, don’t try. We want this document to be understandable and learnable. If we list everything and handle all special cases, this document would be hundreds of pages long and unusable. Instead, we divide these errors into general categories, known as the 5 Game Play Errors defined by the IPG."></annotation>
        <point text="The guide below is designed to give judges a framework for assessing how to handle a Game Play Error."></point>
        <annotation text="While it may be difficult, at first glance, to see which category that some particular infraction falls into, careful reading of the entire infraction — the definition, philosophy, and remedy, can help make the determination."></annotation>
        <point text="Most Game Play Error infractions are assumed to have been committed unintentionally."></point>
        <annotation text="Errors committed intentionally, of course, may fall into a different category altogether: Unsporting Conduct — Cheating. However, it’s important to notice that not all game errors are cheating. In fact, very few actually are."></annotation>
        <annotation text="We like to assume players are nice, and when we walk up to a table, we aren’t accusing people of cheating. That might change once we ask a few questions, but when we start out, our baseline assumption is that we are dealing with an honest mistake."></annotation>
        <point text=" If the judge believes that the error was intentional, they should first consider whether an Unsporting Conduct — Cheating infraction has occurred."></point>
        <annotation text="This is the other side of the coin; even if the task of a judge is always to help the players, we must never forget that they can lie or cheat to get an advantage. The experience and advice of more experienced judges can help to frame the situation correctly and to find out if a player was aware of committing an offense or not."></annotation>
        <point text="With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never upgraded, the third or subsequent penalty for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days."></point>
        <annotation text="We want players to learn something from their mistakes and take care to not commit them again in the future. If a player repeatedly makes mistakes, the Warning is not doing its job of reinforcing the lesson, and therefore we must increase the severity of the penalty to a Game Loss. When giving a Game Play Error to a player, be sure to ask if they have received the infraction before. Note that this is the third or subsequent penalty, not Warning. If a player has received two Game Rule Violations that have been upgraded to Game Losses, and they commit a third Game Rule Violation, that is still upgraded to a Game Loss as well."></annotation>
        <annotation text="Regarding the Failure to Maintain Game State infraction, be prepared for some players to not understand why they are getting a Warning. “But judge, I didn’t do anything wrong?” Take a few seconds to explain to the player why they are getting the Warning, and if they still wishes to discuss it, you can talk about it after the match. While they still get the Warning, we do not upgrade this infraction as we do other tournament errors. This is because we do not want players to fear calling a judge. Being awarded a Game Loss because my opponents made play mistakes and I didn’t catch doesn’t make sense. And, if this is the third time that my opponent has made a play mistake that I didn’t catch over the course of the tournament, I might be reluctant to call a judge and have my Failure to Maintain Game State upgraded, so I choose to pretend that I didn’t notice. We don’t want our policy to encourage cheating. If we don’t upgrade this penalty, though, why give Warnings at all? There are two reasons: the first is that the act of receiving a Warning is generally enough to remind a player to pay more attention. The second is so we can track them. If a player tends to get Failure to Maintain Game State a lot, and the related error is always in their favor, this gives judges the ability to track these infractions — and when added to the larger infraction database, we can track across events too."></annotation>
		<point text="For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days."></point>
		<annotation text="Multi-day tournaments reset between days because it was determined to be unreasonable that the upgrade path was held at three regardless of the number of rounds in an event — it’s much easier to accumulate three GPEs over a fifteen round Grand Prix than a five round MCQ."></annotation>

    <point text="3. Tournament Errors">
        <point text="3.1 Tardiness">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Game Loss"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player is not in their seat at the beginning of a round, or has not completed tasks assigned within the time allocated."></point>
            <annotation text="There are many parts of a Magic Tournament that revolve around time — 20 minutes for this, 10 minutes for that. Players are given sufficient time to accomplish tasks, and failure to complete these tasks within the time limits slows the event down."></annotation>
            <point text="If a round begins before the previous round would have ended (due to all players finishing early), tardiness does not apply until the scheduled end of the previous round."></point>
            <annotation text="This happens rarely at competitive events, but occasionally all the match results are in with 10 minutes remaining on the clock. Round started at 1:00, and at 1:40, everything is done. Let’s go ahead and start the next round! The problem here is that the announced end time was 1:50. It’s unrealistic to expect a player who finished early and ran to get some food to know that the round is starting early. Therefore, even if you start the next round at 1:43, people aren’t actually late until 1:50. When they show up, give the appropriate time extension based on the 1:43 start time, but the penalty based on the 1:50 start time. This means that it’s possible that starting a round early won’t result in any actual saved time, but it’s still more likely to do so than not."></annotation>
            <point text="If, before or during a match, a player requests and receives permission from a judge for a delay for a legitimate task, such as a bathroom break or finding replacements for missing cards, that player has up to 10 minutes to perform that task before they are considered tardy. If the player takes more than 10 minutes, a Match Loss will be applied. Otherwise, no penalty will be applied and a time extension given for the time taken."></point>
            <annotation text="This part here should be pretty self explanatory. If the player needs to perform a legitimate task, let them. Smoking, or buying snacks, or finishing a trade aren’t legitimate reasons. This also doesn’t mean that they have unlimited time.  In fact, they should perform the task without delay.  Impress upon them that they need to hurry back.  They have up to 10 minutes to accomplish the task, at which point, if they haven’t completed it, they receive a Match Loss and are dropped from the event, the same as the standard Tardiness upgrade.  This is to mitigate the impact to the event as long extensions impact everyone else.  It is also to establish an absolute upper bound on how much time a player to perform the task.  Now, that doesn’t mean the player can wander off and do other things as well.  If they were given time to go to the bathroom, that doesn’t include stopping at the counter to buy a snack."></annotation>
            <annotation text="When the player returns, give the match the appropriate extension."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player arrives to their seat 5 minutes after the round begins."></example>
            <annotation text="If a player isn’t in their seat when the round starts, they are tardy. As we will see below, the Tournament Organizer/Head Judge may allow some additional time before this penalty is assessed, but 5 minutes is outside what is reasonable to allow."></annotation>
            <example text="- B. A player hands in their decklist after the time designated by the judge or organizer."></example>
            <annotation text="Again, time limits are in place for a reason. Players are expected to turn in lists at the appropriate time. Allowing them additional time to tweak their deck gives them an advantage."></annotation>
            <example text="- C. A player loses their deck and cannot find replacement cards within the first 10 minutes of the round."></example>
            <annotation text="In addition to being on-time for a match, a player is expected to be on-time with their stuff. However, if they arrive on time and discover that they have lost their deck or some cards, we do allow them time to go find replacements.  This is not a Game Loss at this time.  However, the player has a maximum of 10 minutes into the round to find replacements.  If they exceed this time limit, give the player Tardiness with the upgraded penalty."></annotation>
            <example text="- D. A player sits at an incorrect table and plays the wrong opponent."></example>
            <annotation text="While you can try to make an argument that the player was on time, they still weren’t in the right place. I can be on time too, if I can be at the concession stand when time is called."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Players are responsible for being on time and in the correct seat for their matches, and for completing registrations in a timely manner."></point>
            <annotation text="We want players to be on time. Players should not be sitting around waiting for their opponents to show up. It’s unfair to the people who follow the rules. Also, because matches are 50 minutes, if a player is late, we give a time extension so that they have 50 minutes. This means the tournament as a whole can be delayed. Judges like the trains to run on time, so we treat Tardiness very seriously. We give it a Game Loss, so that players treat it seriously as well. If Tardiness was always just a warning, there wouldn’t be much incentive to be in your seat at the start of the round after you decided to go and get food."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The same logic applies to turning in decklists. Players respond to incentives. And a Game Loss for not completing decklist registration is an incentive to be on time."></annotation>
            <point text="The Tournament Organizer may announce that they are giving the players some additional time before a penalty is issued. Otherwise, the penalty is issued as soon as the round begins."></point>
            <annotation text="Occasionally a Tournament Organizer (or Head Judge) will allow players a bit more time to get to their seats. This is generally used when there is something odd with the venue that hinders players moving around (too many people for the store, pairings in choke points, having to use a second room, etc.) If this is the case, it is announced at the beginning of the event, and doesn’t change. The length of the additional time is also variable. It used to be set to 3 minutes, but now Tournament Organizers have options. However, it is not recommended you go over 3 minutes. If there was no “grace period”, the penalty is earned at the beginning of the round."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="The players are given a time extension corresponding to the length of the tardiness."></point>
            <annotation text="If the tardy player does show up, give the match an extension, even if there is a Game Loss. The players still get the 50 minute match that they paid for. They probably won’t need it, but they still get it."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="A player not in their seat 10 minutes into the round will receive a Match Loss and will be dropped from the tournament unless they report to the Head Judge or Scorekeeper before the end of the round."></point>
            <annotation text="At the 10 minutes into the round, the player gets another Tardiness penalty, with a penalty of a Match Loss. It’s assumed that the player isn’t coming back, so please mark that the player is dropping on the match slip. It is best practice to let the player who got the win fill out the slip, with the judge marking “No Show” for the player who didn’t show up in the drop column, and putting the judge’s name on the line for the player’s signature who didn’t show up."></annotation>
            <title text="Downgrade"></title>
            <point text="A player who arrives at their seat before 1 minute has elapsed in the round receives a Warning."></point>
			<annotation text="Players have a one minute period of time from the start of round to get to their seats. Before we get into the philosophy of this downgrade, we want to explicitly call out that if you get two warnings for the same Tournament Error, that Warning is Upgraded. It is not explicitly called out here because it is in the Tournament Errors section. But in essence this downgrade allows a one time “oopsie” by the player. Philosophically Judges had been executing a policy of “0 with a heart”. What that meant was, if the player was genuinely trying to get to their seat, we allowed a little bit of leniency if a player was ~20 seconds late, as this penalty is meant to punish those not paying attention, as opposed to those really trying. However, this had two problems. The first is that it introduced some subjectivity into a ruling. The judge basically had to determine if the player had a genuine reason for being late. The second is that players caught on to this, and would argue for the subjective leniency, and try to make the judge out as being a jerk for not granting it. This downgrade removes both problems. Be sure to ask if a player has received this penalty prior in the day before assessing the penalty."></annotation>

            <annotation text="As soon as a player has sat for a match, they are not allowed to get instructions or information about the match from other people. Casual chat is not forbidden, unless such chats include information which may benefit the player’s match. This does not include asking for advice at the pairings board or dealer booth, or outside while smoking. Players are going to chat about decks they played against or think they have to play against. We cannot control what they talk about in the restroom."></annotation>
            <point text="- Gives play advice or reveals private information to players who have sat for their match."></point>
            <annotation text="This scenario often happens to a spectator or a player who is watching a friend playing after just finishing their own match. Especially for players who are still in the tournament, such behavior should be punished and the Match Loss should be issued. Keep in mind we are talking about “play advice.” “Don’t forget to attack” is play advice; “Quit, so we can go get food” is not play advice — although both may result in the game ending."></annotation>
            <point text="- During a game, refers to notes (other than Oracle™ pages) made before the official beginning of the current match."></point>
            <annotation text="The form notes take can be varied, but are typically on paper. While looking at these notes between games is OK, during a game it is not permitted. As an exception, official Oracle text is allowed to be checked at any time during the match. Typically players will just call a judge, but if someone has a printout of all the oracle text of all the cards in the set, they can use it as long as they are quick."></annotation>
            <point text="These criteria also apply to any deck construction and draft portions of a limited tournament. Additionally, no notes of any kind may be made during a draft. Some team formats have additional communication rules that may modify the definition of this infraction."></point>
            <annotation text="During a Limited format event, either sealed events or drafts, players in the deck construction or draft portions shall be treated as though they were “in a match”, and any behavior which fits the definition above is regarded as “Outside Assistance.” Asking what to draft, or how many Forests should be played, or “Did you force White?” are examples. For some formats, such as Two-Headed Giant and Team Tournaments, team members can discuss decks and strategies between themselves, and Outside Assistance does not apply."></annotation>
            <point text="Notes made outside the current match may only be referenced between games, and must have been in the player’s possession since the beginning of the match."></point>
            <annotation text="These notes may be things like strategies for sideboarding for different matchups. A note taken in game one can be checked during game two. The “beginning of the match” is the line because there has to be one, and there makes the most sense. Players can’t go online between games and look up sideboard strategy."></annotation>

            <point text="Tournaments test the skill of a player, not their ability to follow external advice or directions. Any strategy advice, play advice, or construction advice from an external source is considered outside assistance."></point>
            <annotation text="A game is between two players. Not a player vs. another player and their friend, or Google, or the Twitterverse. Outside Assistance can be a word, a piece of paper or a gesture; it can be a request for information. If it can be seen to have offered the player strategic, play or construction advice then it should be regarded as outside assistance."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Keep in mind though that asking or telling a player the results of another match is not Outside Assistance, even if that information is used to end the game."></annotation>
            <point text="Visual modifications to cards, including brief text, that provide minor strategic information or hints are acceptable and not considered notes. Detailed instructions or complex strategic advice may not be written on cards. The Head Judge is the final arbiter on what cards and notes are acceptable for a tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Some players write notes on cards, which may contain some strategic information. Several words, a mark, or a picture are tolerable, but sentences may be beyond the line. Examples include dots on the face of sideboard cards, or “attack with me” on a Ball Lightning, or a Trinket Mage altered to be examining a specific artifact (the intended target). If you are not sure whether such visual modification is acceptable, ask the Head Judge."></annotation>
            <point text="Spectators who commit this infraction may be asked to leave the venue if they are not enrolled in the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="For the players who are still in the tournament, Outside Assistance may be the Sword of Damocles which prevents them offering advice or seeking suggestions from others. However, spectators do not need to worry about the potential punishment because they do not have a “next match” for a Match Loss to apply to. In these case, judges should ask the spectators to leave the venue politely; this provides a warning to other spectators who can’t help talking about the current match when they are watching others."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Not being enrolled in the tournament doesn’t protect you from this infraction. If a spectator commits this infraction and is not enrolled in the tournament, enroll them, assign the infraction, then drop them from the event."></annotation>

            <point text="If the information acquired is information that the player would have access to between games, the penalty is a Game Loss."></point>
            <annotation text="This downgrade reflects that the advantage that you might gain for accessing information that you are allowed to access between games is likely to be less than if you access information that you wouldn’t normally have access to between games.

There is no explicit number of seconds to make a decision. If we say “taking longer than 30 seconds to make a decision is slow play,” then players can legally take 29 seconds to make every decision, and we have just legalized Stalling. Making a slow play call as a judge is subjective, therefore judges have to use their best judgment when making them. Two methods judges have reported using are:"></annotation>
            <annotation text="– If you have had time to assess the board, figure out what to do, and then get bored, it’s slow play."></annotation>

Keep in mind they are very difficult to tell apart, and typically revolves around how much the player was aware of the remaining time on the clock."></annotation>
            <point text="It is also slow play if a player continues to execute a loop without being able to provide an exact number of iterations and the expected resulting game state."></point>
            <annotation text="This is one of those sentences that whole articles can be written about. Most loops have a finite ending — I do X 10 times, but stop early if Y happens. Using the rules for shortcuts as found in the MTR, you must also be able to explain the specific end state. There are many loops out there where they will reach a certain condition “eventually.” Eventually is not a specific number. These loop end states are also not specific enough. You cannot perform the loop “Mill myself until the last 2 cards in my library are Emrakul” because you can’t specify how many times you will need to loop to get to that state. You could loop “A million times!” but there is still a chance it won’t happen until the million and first. Fine, I loop 2 Million times! There is still the chance it won’t happen. It doesn’t matter how small the chance of failure is; if it’s there, you can’t loop.  Also, if the opponent wants to respond when you have milled both Emrakuls and both shuffle triggers are on the stack, how do you determine which state happens first?"></annotation>

This nudge is not a formal penalty or a Warning, it’s a ‘caution.’ If the player makes their play quickly and continues at a reasonable pace, everything is fine.

            <annotation text="While a penalty for lost cards may seem harsh, players have the option to replace those lost cards with another copy; if they can find it.

            <annotation text="As explained above, the decklist is a written record of what the player intends to play throughout the day. It’s important that judges have access to a reliable record of a player’s deck for investigations."></annotation>
            <point text="Judges and other tournament officials should be vigilant about reminding players before the tournament begins of the importance of submitting a legal decklist, and playing with a legal deck."></point>
            <annotation text="Making announcements at the start of a tournament can prevent a lot of the errors that could occur in a tournament; for example, “check your decklists to ensure that you have at least 60 cards in your main deck and up to 15 cards in your sideboard”."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Decklists are often a rushed last-minute job, so by providing an extra minute or two during a players meeting to check for last-minute issues many of these errors can be prevented."></annotation>
            <point text="A player normally receives a Game Loss if their decklist is altered after tournament play has begun."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence is to reinforce that when parts of this infraction require that the decklist be changed to match the deck that is being played the Game Loss penalty should also be issued. The sentence says “normally” because there is a corner case where the player is unable to replace a lost card, receives the penalty, yet later is able to replace it. In that case, we can change the list back to its original configuration without issuing a penalty."></annotation>
            <point text="Penalties for decklist errors discovered outside the context of the match and its procedures (such as those discovered through decklist counting) are issued at the start of the next match unless the judge believes there is strong evidence the deck itself is illegal."></point>
            <annotation text="If an error is discovered during a deck check, the penalty is issued immediately. The players aren’t playing. Issue the penalty. Apply the fix, and if the match isn’t over, get the players playing as quickly as possible."></annotation>
            <annotation text="At events, judges will occasionally also check lists for legality outside of deck checks. If a problem is found with a list outside of a deck check, then the penalty should be assessed at the start of the next match. This is mostly for consistency. If we check a list and find a problem with 10 min remaining the the round, the current match may still be in progress, or may have finished. If it’s still going, that game loss will likely end the match. This means the penalty can effectively be harsher based on where in the stack of decklists the player’s list was. To balance this, we assess the penalties at the beginning of the next round. Now, this doesn’t apply if you feel the deck is illegal; for example, a Modern decklist containing Mental Misstep. You can inspect the library of the player. If the deck is in fact illegal, go ahead and issue the infraction. Otherwise, issue the penalty and resolve the fix between rounds, with the infraction taking effect at the beginning of the next match."></annotation>
            <point text="Ambiguous or unclear names on a decklist may allow a player to manipulate the contents of their deck up until the point at which they are discovered."></point>
            <annotation text="Writing down ambiguous or incorrect card names can be a player attempting to cheat. They could be attempting to give themselves some flexibility to modify their deck to match the field, while claiming they just took a shortcut writing down the name."></annotation>
            <point text="Truncated names of storyline characters on decklists (planeswalkers and other legendary permanents) are acceptable as long as they are the only representation of that character in the format and are treated as referring to that card, even if other cards begin with the same name."></point>
            <annotation text="In the case of storyline figures, it is often easy to see which card a player means. If a player lists “4 Ulrich”, that player is unlikely to be talking about Ulrich’s Kindred, despite it beginning with the same series of letters. In this case of Legendary Permanents and Planeswalkers, there is an exception to the requirement that cards be listed by their full name, but the card names still need to be uniquely identifiable. Listing “4 Jace” on a Legacy decklist, however, is not be good enough, since there are multiple representations of “Jace” that are legal in the format. If judges allowed a player to list “4 Jace” without it being considered an infraction, a player could take advantage of the ambiguity by swapping between Jace, Memory Adept and Jace, the Mind Sculptor as necessary to gain an advantage without fear of ever receiving a Game Loss."></annotation>
            <point text="The Head Judge may choose to not issue this penalty if they believe that what the player wrote on their decklist is obvious and unambiguous, even if not entirely accurate. In Limited tournaments, the Head Judge may choose not to issue this penalty for incorrectly marked basic land counts if they believe the correct land count is obvious. This should be determined solely by what is written on the decklist, and not based on intent or the actual contents of the deck; needing to check the deck for confirmation is a sign that the entry is not obvious."></point>
            <annotation text="Checking and confirming the cards in the deck against the decklist in this situation causes unnecessary work for the deck check team. If the error is extremely obvious and the correct card name can only be one thing, then there is no ambiguity. If the error is obvious, there is truly no question of what the card is. There is not even a reason to check. In those cases, the HJ is allowed to choose not to issue a penalty. It’s not even a warning. However, not all judges see ‘obvious’ the same way. Some tend to be a little too loose and free with what obvious means. To determine if obvious is obvious enough, use these guidelines: If you have to spend time debating if it’s obvious, it’s not obvious. If you have to actually check the deck to see what they are really playing, it’s not obvious enough. For example “U/B Shockland” is an obvious card, so is Temple of B/G. I do not need to look at the actual deck to know what either of those are. Same with ‘Bob’. ‘Goyf’ is riskier, but the author feels that is just on the side of ‘ok’."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Now what about a situation where the player writes down the wrong card name, such as Temple of Malady in the B/R deck that physically runs Temple of Malice, and it is caught during a deck check. Is it a clerical error? Probably. Is it obvious that the meant Temple of Malice? Not by looking solely at the decklist. So this scenario would not be eligible for a downgrade."></annotation>

            <point text="If the decklist contains illegal cards, remove them."></point>

            <annotation text="To fix the error, we want to ensure that the player is playing what they intended to play – we do not force the deck to match the decklist; instead we alter the decklist to reflect the deck. The deck that a player has presented is more frequently what they intended to play."></annotation>
            <point text="If the deck/sideboard and decklist both violate a maximum cards restriction (usually too many cards in a sideboard, more than four of a card, or the same card in two decks in a Unified Constructed format), remove cards as directed by the player to make the decklist legal."></point>
            <annotation text="In this case you need to remove cards from the players deck.  The player decides what they remove in order to make the quantity of cards legal.  In the case of Unified Constructed Team formats, the team can decide who is the player that needs to change their list.  The result is, the player whose decklist changes gets the Game Loss. The players may discuss this, but they may not take too long.  This may result in a “strategic decision”, but that’s an acceptable consequence."></annotation>
            <point text="If the deck contains too few cards, the player chooses to add any combination of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain or Forest to reach the minimum number. Alter the decklist to reflect this."></point>
            <annotation text="While some decks might start out with too few cards, some decks will drop below a legal amount after illegal cards have been removed. In addition, cards may be lost and the player unable to find replacements. To fix these problems, judges can add Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, or Forests of the player’s choice to their deck, so that it becomes playable. Because some formats have special restrictions on Snow-Covered basics or Wastes, and their availability is not guaranteed, they are not allowed."></annotation>
            <point text="These changes may be reverted without penalty if the player is subsequently able to locate identical replacements to legal original cards."></point>
            <annotation text="If lost cards are found, it’s ok to remove the additional basic land cards and allow the player to play with the cards that are supposed to be in their deck."></annotation>

This can normally be caught through the process of deck checks, and decklists are there so that players can have a written record of what they intend to play. If it is inaccurate, there is little point in the decklist existing at all. A common way this error can occur is when a player fails to desideboard after a match, then presents a deck in a sideboarded configuration for game 1 of their next match. Also possible here is the case of a player scooping up cards at the end of a game and now having one or more of an opponents cards in their deck when presenting (or, alternatively, missing one or more cards from their deck)."></annotation>
            <point text="If there are extra cards stored with the sideboard that could conceivably be played in the player’s deck, they will be considered a part of the sideboard unless they are:"></point>

            <annotation text="It is important that the sideboard is kept physically far enough away that it doesn’t become mixed with the player’s library. Cards in a deckbox that could conceivably be used in the deck can be suspicious, and provide an opportunity for the player to cheat by being added to the deck in between games. We want to remove this opportunity and so cards in the deckbox are considered to be part of the sideboard unless explicitly excepted. It can be a good idea for a supplementary announcement involving cards in deckboxes to be issued so that we can curb this behavior."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players that present their sideboard by removing it from their deck box and identifying it to the opponent at the start of the match should not receive this penalty, even if there are other cards remaining in the deck box that don’t fit one of the above exceptions.

            <annotation text="Promotional cards that were given out at the tournament have an exception because otherwise, we would be giving players a Game Loss during every deck check at a Grand Prix.  Double Faced cards have an exception because…where else are you supposed to keep them if you are using checklist cards?

            <point text="Cards in different sleeves, tokens, and double-faced cards for which checklists are being used are ignored when determining deck (not sideboard) legality."></point>
            <annotation text="If your card is in my deck, and it’s obvious from the back of the sleeve that it doesn’t belong in the deck, then I don’t get a penalty. Also, tokens aren’t cards, so they don’t count anyway. Don’t forget to make sure they still have a 60 card deck after you remove the offenders; that part is still illegal.  Additionally meld cards count as double-faced cards here."></annotation>
            <point text="If a player is unable to locate cards (or identical equivalents) from their main deck, treat it as a Decklist Problem instead. If sideboard cards are missing, make a note of this, but issue no penalty."></point>
            <annotation text="If a player has lost one or more cards in their deck, and has no quick way to replace them (if it’s a mythic that the venue is sold out of, for instance, or they don’t wish to buy replacements), then the infraction is Decklist Problem, rather than Deck Problem since they can no longer play a deck that matches the list as intended. In fact, this particular case is example D. in Decklist problem – “A player loses some cards and is unable to find replacement copies, making her unable to play a deck that matches her decklist.”"></annotation>
            <annotation text="If sideboard cards are wrong or inaccurate, a penalty may be merited due to the potential for advantage. Conversely, losing sideboard cards cannot provide an advantage – in fact, it is a disadvantage – so we do not need to add insult to injury by applying a penalty as well. Players can’t spend unreasonable amounts of time searching for replacement sideboard cards, but “found” sideboard cards after this measure has been implemented may be added back into the deck."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that often times in limited events, players trade, throw away, or file in with the rest of their collections all cards from their pool that are not in their main deck.

            <annotation text="For the first example, we have a deck that is not legal, though the decklist itself IS legal.

Example C is a failure to de-sideboard error, which results in the deck not matching that configuration which is intended for game 1."></annotation>

            <annotation text="If a player does not call attention to a deck error they notice right away, they may reasonably be considered to be trying to gain an advantage from it.

            <point text="The most common forms of deck error are failure to desideboard and having a card in the wrong deck. Both of these are difficult to gain advantage from without obvious cheating. Allowing the opponent to choose which card they would otherwise be working with is sufficient to compensate for the easily discovered situations."></point>
            <annotation text="Since these two errors are both common (ish) and, as stated, difficult to take advantage of without being very obviously cheating, the penalty of a warning should be enough to educate the players to not repeat the infraction. Alongside the fix of removing the errant cards, this should combine to be enough of a deterrent."></annotation>
            <point text="Duplicates of cards that begin in the main deck are more problematic, as they are not as easy to realize and catch, and thus mandate an upgraded penalty."></point>
            <annotation text="It’s much simpler to abuse a case where the library has additional copies of a card from the sideboard in game 1 of a match. It’s also much harder to catch, and, as a result, needs to have a harsher penalty associated with it to dissuade the potential for abuse."></annotation>
            <point text="A window in which the error is a Game Loss is necessary to discourage intentional abuse of the minimum number of cards in the deck.

            <annotation text="This section refers to the window in the first upgrade path discussed below. The window for the upgrade needs to exist as a harsher discouragement against cheating.

            <point text="Locate any cards missing from the deck and any incorrect cards in any game zone. Reveal those cards to the opponent."></point>
			<annotation text="Once the deck has been determined to be in an incorrect configuration, we want to return it to the intended configuration as simply as possible. To start fixing things, find all the cards that are present in the game that shouldn’t be there, and all the cards that are missing from the game, and reveal these to the opponent."></annotation>
			<annotation text="For example, assume that a player registered a deck with two Snapcaster Mage, one Crucible of Worlds, and with four Rest in Peace in the sideboard. In their last match, they took out the two Snapcaster Mages and the Crucible, while bringing in the four Rest in Peace. They played 61/14 for that game, which was legal. Now, however, they forgot to desideboard before their next match started. They Scryed a Rest in Peace to the bottom at one point, later drew a Rest in Peace. Then, they realized the error. The judge should determine that there is one Rest in Peace erroneously in the hand, three erroneously in the library, two missing Snapcaster Mages, and one missing Crucible."></annotation>
			<point text="The opponent chooses which of the missing cards replaces each incorrect card; any extras are shuffled into the random portion of the library. If more cards are being removed than added, prioritize ones not in the library first."></point>
			<annotation text="Now, reveal all of these incorrect cards to the opponent. For each card that is there incorrectly, the opponent chooses which missing card will replace it, starting with cards not in the library. Be sure to keep any parts of the library that are in a known order stay that way."></annotation>
			<annotation text="For instance, continuing the example from above, reveal the 7 incorrect cards to the opponent. First, replace the Rest in Peace in hand with either a Snapcaster Mage or a Crucible- whichever the opponent decides. Then, replace the three Rest in Peace copies in the library with the remaining two cards. Note that they can choose to replace either the copies in the random portion of the library, or the known card on the bottom of the library."></annotation>
			<point text="If there are still additional cards not in the library that need replacing, they are replaced by cards from the random portion of the library."></point>
			<annotation text="If the player was playing a 61st card from the sideboard but hadn’t taken anything out, that will be replaced by a random card from the library. Most commonly, this will be accomplished by simply drawing a card now."></annotation>
			<point text="If the missing card(s) are with the sideboard and it isn’t the first game, choose the ones to be returned to the deck at random from main deck cards in the sideboard."></point>
            <annotation text="This case can occur when a player is looking through their deckbox (say to grab a token or something) and notices a card present with the sideboard that should be in the deck. If the deck is determined to be incorrect (specifically if there is 59 or fewer cards, or the deck is otherwise somehow illegal, not that a player intended to sideboard a card in and missed their opportunity to do so), we can restore the deck to a legal configuration by randomly adding a card back in from the sideboard. Note- this fix should only return main deck cards into the deck."></annotation>
			<point text="If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck, issue penalties to both players."></point>

            <point text="If the deck or sideboard is discovered to contain an incorrect number of cards while presented to the opponent for pre-game shuffling, or during a deckcheck, and any missing cards are not in the opponent’s deck, the penalty is a Game Loss."></point>
            <annotation text="This upgrade path exists to discourage cheating. The process of presenting your deck to an opponent is a statement that “this deck is legal and ready for you to shuffle.” If the opponent discovers the deck to be illegal during shuffling or counting, the penalty is upgraded to a Game Loss. Similarly, if this is discovered by a judge during a deck check, the penalty is upgraded."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If an opponent may have made strategic decisions based on the presence of a sideboard card (such as having seen it in the hand or library during a search effect), the penalty is a Game Loss."></point>
            <annotation text="This upgrade path, again, is to discourage cheating. Calling attention to the error only after an opponent has made decisions based on the incorrect card is very suspicious and abusable, so the penalty is a Game Loss to ensure the practice is heavily disincentivized. Of course, investigation needs to occur in these cases to ensure there isn’t actually cheating, but the route for abuse here still warrants a Game Loss penalty."></annotation>
			<title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text=":If an error resulted in more copies of a main deck card being played than were registered and this was discovered after the game had begun, the penalty is a Game Loss unless all copies of the card are still in the random portion of the library. For example if the decklist has two copies of Shock in the main deck and two in the sideboard, but a search finds two copies of Shock in the library with another already in the graveyard, the penalty is upgraded."></point>
            <annotation text="The upgrade applies here because there is no way to know if an advantage has already been gained. Typically, you aren’t going to realize you have three copies of shock until you have already seen/drawn/cast the previous two. In the extremely rare case that a player has enough copies to realize this error in their opening hand (so, 3 or 4 shocks in that hand in the example given), the penalty is not upgraded as long as they call a judge before taking a game action."></annotation>

            <annotation text="A technical error in this situation means any error that is involved with the drafting process. When this infraction is given out, the scenario is normally, but not always, a timed draft. This means that we have some serious time constraints to complete the draft within. Technical errors like this cause delays, and at something like a Grand Prix Day 2 draft, will cause the entire room to be held up."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player passes a booster to their left when it is supposed to go to their right."></example>
            <annotation text="If a player does this, it can have a cascade effect on the rest of the draft — either it is caught immediately by a player either side of the offending player, or the booster is picked up and used to make picks, further complicating the problem."></annotation>
            <example text="- B. A player exceeds the amount of time allotted for a draft pick."></example>
            <annotation text="A timed draft is timed so that the draft can be carried out in an efficient and timely manner, in addition to the added benefits of coordinating multiple drafts at once. If a player exceeds the time limit, that player is again causing a delay to the draft, which is not a thing that should go unnoticed."></annotation>
            <example text="- C. A player puts a card on top of their draft pile, then pulls it back."></example>
            <annotation text="This is a large concern, as when a player does this, it can look to other players, spectators, and judges as though the player has taken more than one card from the booster pack. This has one of two resolutions — the player is “allowed” to take these two cards, or the time of Tournament Officials is taken up by a “non-issue”. Either of these are bad for the tournament integrity — they can increase the chance of mixing cards from the pack with cards that are already selected. Players are instructed in timed drafts to select a card at a specific point — not doing this at that point can fall under issue b) above."></annotation>
            <example text="- D. A player moves their head to the side at inappropriate times."></example>
            <annotation text="This example gives judges some leeway to use LPV when they see a player making movements with their head. Use common sense here and be sure to consider Cheating if you believe the player is doing this to obtain hidden information."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>

For Modern Masters drafts, it is possible that the draft is interrupted by the presence of a foil in each pack. For draft formats involving Innistrad and Dark Ascension drafts, the Head Judge may wish to announce a specific way to handle double-faced cards with regards to this infraction. It allows some additional instruction or leeway – based on the decision of the Head Judge – to be given. This sentence basically gives the judge the power required to make a draft occur in a specific way if needed."></annotation>

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player violates the Communication policies detailed in section 4 of the Magic Tournament Rules and the judge believes their opponent has taken an in-game action or clearly chosen not to act based on the erroneous information. This infraction only applies to violations of that policy and not to general communication confusion."></point>
            <annotation text="It is important to remember that this infraction only covers violations of the Communication Policy in the Magic Tournament Rules (section 4) and only if the judge believes that the opponent has made decisions based upon the incorrect information."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player is asked how many cards they have in their hand and answers “Three.” A few moments later, their opponent casts a discard spell and they realize that they have four."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player keeps their Llanowar Elf in with their land, and their opponent attacks thinking they have no blockers."></example>
            <example text="- A player casts Path to Exile, and forgets to remind their opponent that they have the opportunity to search for a basic land."></example>
            <annotation text="In each of these examples, a player takes an action or fails to take an action in a way that is impacted by illegal communication. In the first example, the opponent makes a choice regarding the discard spell assuming that the player has three cards in their hand, while they actually have four. In the second, the player has violated section 4.7 of the MTR by keeping a creature with their lands, and the opponent assumes that the player has no blockers. In the third case, the player violates MTR 4.2 by assuming that the opponent chose not to search. In each case, it isn’t the illegal information that causes the infraction, but rather the opponent acting on the illegal information. If a player keeps their Llanowar Elf with their lands, but the opponent doesn’t make an attack assuming that the player has no blockers, then no infraction has occurred. However, judges should step in to clarify the board state before an infraction occurs."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Clear communication is essential when playing Magic. Though many offenses will be intentional, it is possible for a player to make a genuine mistake that causes confusion and these should not be penalized harshly."></point>
            <annotation text="We all agree that playing magic face to face is quite different from playing Magic Online on a computer. Clear communication should help players express their thoughts and ensure that the game can be played. We want players to talk to each other. We want them to communicate. But players are human, and they will make mistakes. For these violations, the player should be given a Warning. We don’t want a more severe penalty, because we don’t want players scared to communicate with each other for fear of getting a penalty."></annotation>
            <point text="A player may commit this infraction in situations where they have not spoken."></point>
            <annotation text="This can occur in many different ways. As another example, a player might control Dusk Charger, but not have represented that they have the city’s blessing. If the opponent acts on the belief that the player does not have the city’s blessing and assumes that the Dusk Charger is only a 3/3, a CPV has occurred."></annotation>
            <point text="A physically ambiguous board state is not automatically a penalty, but judges are encouraged to tell players to fix ambiguous placements before they might become problematic."></point>
            <annotation text="As above, in the example where Llanowar Elves was with the player’s lands, no CPV occurs until the opponent acts on the bad information. Judges should encourage clear board states even before an infraction occurs."></annotation>
            <point text="Misapplication of a shortcut is usually not a Communication Policy Violation, as the default interpretation applies in ambiguous situations and the opponent is able to act on that shortcut. Any deviation from a tournament shortcut requires a clear explanation."></point>
            <annotation text="Just misunderstanding a shortcut isn’t a CPV. Since the default shortcuts described in MTR 4.2 are well-defined, those definitions can be applied in ambiguous situations."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="A backup may be considered to the point of the action, not the erroneous communication."></point>
            <annotation text="Sometimes a violation of the communication policy doesn’t matter. Sometimes it does. Typically a judge, will only get calls “when it matters,” and will need to consider if a backup is appropriate. If when asked what the power/toughness of a creature is, the player responds “2/3,” the opponent might feel safe attacking with a 3/3. If during declare blockers it’s discovered to be a 3/4 then different choices could have been made. This wasn’t a play mistake or a strategic error, and if a judge is being called, it is clear that a player took actions based upon that incorrect information. In this instance a backup to before attackers have been declared, as outlined in section IPG 1.4 Backing Up, should be considered."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Any backup should only go to when the opponent acted on the incorrect information, and not before then.

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="Cards or sleeves in a player’s deck have inconsistencies on them that might allow them to be differentiated from each other while in the library. This includes scuff marks, nail marks, discoloration, bent corners, and curving from foils."></point>
            <annotation text="A card should be identifiable only from its front face. Being able to identify what a card is, or what card type it is, from anything other than its front face is an issue. This applies to physical markings, such as scratches, dings, and scuffs, as well as to physical orientation – for example, if all of a player’s lands are turned upside down in their deck. If a single card can be identified side-on (i.e. while mash shuffling), this is also a problem that needs to be fixed by replacing the card, or sleeve, depending on the issue. Please note, this infraction only addresses issues with potential abuse. If we feel there is actual abuse, then we are now considering Cheating."></annotation>
            <annotation text="We only issue this infraction if the marked cards are in a player’s deck, not the sideboard. If the cards in the sideboard have different markings or the sleeves appear newer we should only issue this infraction after sideboarding the marked cards into the deck. If the sideboard cards are noticed during a deck check the player should be made aware of this and suggested to use the main deck sleeves when sideboarding."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player has small marks on a few of their sleeves. The markings are on a Mountain, a Loxodon Hierarch, and a Lightning Helix."></example>
            <annotation text="There is not a great argument for a land, a creature, and an instant being a pattern of marked cards. However, cards that are individually marked in this fashion are still an issue. If the player notices these markings, that player can make an assumption that “this card in my 60 card deck is a mountain, a Loxodon Hierarch, or a Lightning Helix,” giving the player undue knowledge about what that card might be."></annotation>
            <example text="- B. A player has several foil cards that stand out significantly from the rest of their deck."></example>
            <annotation text="Foils have a tendency to bend inwards. It is possible, and with bad handling, for these cards to be warped in such a way that they are noticeable. Again, knowing which foils the player has in their deck, that player can make a more accurate assumption about what the bent card is. It should be noted that not all foils are marked, and not all bent cards are foils. Let’s be very clear here, the fact that your deck contains foils in a specific pattern (all lands, for example) does not mean the deck is marked; the markings arise from the bends (if they exist)."></annotation>
            <example text="- C. The basic lands in a player’s unsleeved deck are from a set with notably lighter backs."></example>
            <annotation text="Having noticeably lighter backs makes these cards marked. Because it is all the basic lands this fits the upgrade path outlined in the additional remedy, since substantial advantage can be gained knowing if the top card of the library is a land just be seeing the different back."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Sleeves and cards often become worn over the course of a tournament, and, as long as the player is not attempting to take advantage of this, addressing the situation is sufficient in most cases. Note that almost all sleeves can be considered marked in some way; judges should keep this in mind when determining penalties."></point>
            <annotation text="Tournaments are long, with many larger tournaments involving over 8 hours of actual Magic gameplay. Playing Magic — especially shuffling cards — over an 8 hour period will cause sleeve splits, and it will cause dings, dents, and scuffs. As long as these markings do not make a card identifiable, it is simple enough just to point out this error, give the penalty and get the player to replace the sleeves. Be careful, though — if you stare long enough, you can probably find markings on all but the newest sleeves. This does not mean they are marked."></annotation>
            <point text="In cases of marked cards, educating players to shuffle their cards and sleeves before sleeving the cards is very important."></point>
            <annotation text="It’s always important to explain why players are getting a particular penalty, but with Marked Cards, you need to explain how to prevent further occurrences. Typically the players won’t know anything is wrong until you tell them."></annotation>
            <annotation text="There are some additional steps the players should take when sleeving up their deck. For example, players should shuffle their sleeves as well as their decks prior to sleeving, in case some sleeves are slightly shorter than others (this can happen with sleeves from different packs, even if they’re sold as identical). If the player shuffles the sleeves first, there may be marked cards, necessitating changes, but it is unlikely to be serious. If the player does not shuffle the sleeves first, it could be that the deck is in one size of sleeves and the sideboard in a different size — a much bigger problem (see below)."></annotation>
            <point text="This infraction applies only to cards in a player’s deck. Differently-marked sleeves in the sideboard are not illegal unless they are put into the deck without being changed."></point>
            <annotation text="Let’s say a player’s whole deck is sleeved, but their sideboard is unsleeved.  Are those sideboard cards marked?  Of course not!  These two sentences here delineate the boundary between Marked Cards and cards that are marked, and that boundary is the deck.  Cards in the sideboard can be in any condition until they are put in the deck.  This means during a deck check, you may run across marked sleeves that make sideboard cards stand out, but if they aren’t in a deck, its legal."></annotation>
            <point text="Unless investigating, judges are encouraged to alert players about concerns with marked sideboard cards."></point>
            <annotation text="During a deck check, if you find some sideboard cards that are marked, please notify the player they will need to swap sleeves with their main deck cards.  Do not silently wait to see if they put those cards into the deck and then jump in with a penalty.  Tell them beforehand.  The exception to this is: Investigating.  If you are investigating cheats, you may opt to not tell them so that you can gather more information for your investigation."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="The player needs to replace the card(s) or sleeve(s) with an unmarked version or, if no sleeves are being used, use sleeves that conceal the markings."></point>
            <annotation text="In the event that a player’s cards or sleeves are marked, they need to become unmarked. There are often traders at larger tournaments such as a Grand Prix, and smaller PPTQs and other Competitive REL events are often held in a store, where sleeves may be purchased cheaply and quickly. If we are only talking about a few cards, most packs of sleeves come with a few extra, or perhaps the player can swap marked sleeves with unmarked sleeves from the sideboard. This is especially important in events where a player has not sleeved their decks — with the frequency that a deck of Magic cards must be shuffled, unsleeved cards get marked quickly."></annotation>
            <point text="If the cards themselves have become marked through play in the tournament, the Head Judge may decide to issue a proxy."></point>
            <annotation text="If someone trips over and spills water over a player’s deck, we don’t want it to be the end of that player’s tournament because they can’t play with their cards. Cards damaged or marked in the tournament — as well as misprinted limited product — can have proxies issued at the Head Judge’s discretion, as outlined in MTR 3.4."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If the player is unable to find replacement cards, they may replace those cards with any combination of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain or Forest. As the decklist is being changed to match the new contents of the deck, the penalty is a Game Loss. This change may be reverted at a later point without further penalty if replacements for marked cards are found."></point>
            <annotation text="If a player can no longer play with certain cards due to them being illegal (for example, the player’s four foil Huntmaster of the Fells were bowed, and can’t be used, so the player now has a 56-card deck), the player may replace those cards with other copies of the same card, or with any combination of cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain or Forest. If the player opts to find replacement cards, please ask them to hurry, and give them 10 minutes before assessing a Tardiness Penalty. If the player adds any of the named basic land cards instead, the decklist should be changed to reflect what the player is actually now playing. We issue the player with a Game Loss because of the changed decklist which means they also won’t receive a Decklist Problem penalty if they receive a deck check later. If the player ends up finding replacements for any reason, we can reverse this change, this time without any penalty."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If the Head Judge believes that a deck’s owner noticing the pattern of markings would be able to gain substantial advantage from this knowledge, the penalty is a Game Loss."></point>
            <annotation text="A marking of cards that is a distinguishable pattern is normally more of a problem than the odd scuffed corner. For example, in a case where a player’s sleeves are not opaque, double-faced cards such as Huntmaster of the Fells can be seen through the back of them. Because all of the player’s Huntmasters of the Fells are marked in this way, it is possible to utilize the upgrade path on this. Other examples include: 11 cards have markings in the corner and 10 of them are land; all reanimation targets in a deck are slightly bent; in a post sideboard deck, sideboard cards are noticeably less scuffed."></annotation>

            <point text="Warning"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player unintentionally fails to sufficiently shuffle their deck or a portion of their deck before presenting it to their opponent, or fails to present it to their opponent for further randomization. A deck is not shuffled if the judge believes a player could know the position or distribution of one or more cards in their deck."></point>
            <annotation text="When players shuffle their decks, the purpose is to lose track of individual cards in the deck and put the deck into an unknown order. If you believe it is possible for a player to know the rough position of a card or cards within a deck (i.e. the player knows which quarter a particular card is in, or hasn’t shuffled enough to break up a spell, spell, land order) then the deck is not shuffled enough. The exact number of shuffles needed isn’t something we can accurately specify, as it can change based on the number of cards to randomize, but if you feel a deck might not have been shuffled thoroughly enough then it probably fits this infraction. Once a player has shuffled their deck for any reason, that player is responsible for presenting the deck to the opponent for further randomization. Failure to do so falls under this infraction."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Generally this infraction occurs because the player is lazy, has bad shuffling habits, or their mind is just elsewhere while shuffling. However, if you believe the player intentionally did not shuffle thoroughly, consider Cheating."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player forgets to shuffle their library after searching for a card."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player searches for a card, then gives the library a single riffle-shuffle before presenting the library to their opponent."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player fails to shuffle the portion of their library revealed during the resolution of a cascade ability."></example>
            <annotation text="The first example is pretty simple, “Oops, I forgot to shuffle.” You would think things like this never happen, but with a lot going on in the game it’s possible. The second example is probably the more common one seen among inexperienced players, or players in a hurry — those who just give the library a quick one-two-cut. The third example is just an extension of the first, where someone doesn’t shuffle a portion of the deck, or a pile of cards that are required to be shuffled, either because they forget or because they don’t think they have to."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Players are expected to shuffle their deck thoroughly when it is required and are expected to have the skill and understanding of randomization to do so."></point>
            <annotation text="This is a card game. It requires manipulation of cards. It is the player’s responsibility to be able to randomize those cards, and it is reasonable to expect this behavior from them."></annotation>
            <point text="However, as the opponent has the opportunity to shuffle after the player does, the potential for advantage is lowered if tournament policy is followed."></point>
            <annotation text="It’s easy to try and take advantage of insufficient shuffling, from trying to manipulate the entire deck and its mana distribution, to just trying to manipulate one or two cards’ general position in the deck. The penalty used to be a Game Loss to reflect the potential for advantage. This meant that many new or lazy players would get Game Losses because they didn’t know any better/didn’t think shuffling was a big deal. However, now, the opponent is required to shuffle the library when the deck is presented. This virtually eliminates the potential for advantage. With that rule in place, we are comfortable with the standard penalty now being a Warning."></annotation>
            <point text="Any time cards in a deck could be seen, including during shuffling, it is no longer shuffled, even if the player only knows the position of one or two cards. Players are expected to take care in shuffling not to reveal cards to themselves, their teammates, or their opponents."></point>
            <annotation text="The cards within the deck should not be revealed to anyone while it’s being randomized, otherwise it’s not random (even if the majority of the deck is). If you riffle shuffle ten times, then riffle shuffle one time face up to bend the cards the other way, it’s not shuffled anymore, and you have to start again. In Team games, shuffling away from yourself but towards your teammate is also bad. Shuffling so your opponent can see your cards is not a good idea strategically, but doesn’t receive a penalty."></annotation>
            <point text="A player should shuffle their deck using multiple methods. Patterned pile-shuffling is only allowed at the start of a game."></point>
            <annotation text="When shuffling, multiple types of shuffles should be used together to ensure randomization. Six to eight riffle or “mash” shuffles is sufficient to randomize a deck.  A pile shuffle is not shuffling. It is not part of shuffling. It doesn’t count. You can do it once per game in order to count your cards prior to presenting. If a player pile shuffles more than once, don’t give a penalty, and instead instruct the player on correct shuffling techniques."></annotation>
            <point text="Any manipulation, weaving, or stacking prior to randomization is acceptable, as long as the deck is thoroughly shuffled afterwards."></point>
            <annotation text="When a player sits down, their deck is in some order. It may be sorted alphabetically, or mana weaved or had cards placed in specific places in the deck. While it might raise some concern, all that is fine, so long as the deck is sufficiently randomized afterwards. This is because, so long as the deck is shuffled, any manipulation will be obliterated when the deck is randomized. This randomization is further ensured when the opponent also shuffles the deck. Manipulating a deck prior to sufficient shuffling is really done just for comfort. Manipulating a deck prior to insufficient shuffling is a Warning if done unintentionally, and USC—Cheating if done intentionally."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="Shuffle the appropriate portion of the deck thoroughly."></point>
            <annotation text="The remedy is simple — have them shuffle the cards. You should take some time to quickly explain what kinds of shuffling are necessary and why they’re necessary, as well as reminding the other player to shuffle their opponents deck as well. As a general practice, judges do not perform the shuffle, players do. This prevents the judges from getting involved if sleeves become broken during the shuffle, or if a card falls out. It also prevents the judge from getting blamed if the player draws poorly following the shuffle."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Keep in mind that some of the cards might be ordered within the deck, so their position should be maintained if they weren’t supposed to be included within the shuffle. When trying to fix the insufficient shuffling problem, it’s a good idea to take a look at both player’s graveyard as well as the permanents on the battlefield. Asking questions about the known cards in the library is also necessary. Try to take that into consideration whenever you’re dealing with shuffling."></annotation>

        <point text="If the judge believes that the error was intentional, they should consider Unsporting Conduct — Cheating."></point>
        <annotation text="This note covers cases where the player is breaking a tournament rule intentionally. The player might be cheating, but it might not meet the definition of cheating in the IPG. Be sure to review IPG 4.8 Cheating before taking action."></annotation>
        <point text="If a player violates the Magic Tournament Rules in a way that is not covered by one of the infractions listed below, the judge should explain the appropriate procedure to the player, but not issue a penalty."></point>
        <annotation text="Only the more serious Magic Tournament Rules warrant a penalty. These rules can be quite disruptive to the overall flow of the tournament, causing the event to go longer than needed and/or can give a player a significant advantage. If a violation to the Magic Tournament Rules is not considered detrimental to the overall flow of the event, then a penalty is not needed and the judge will simply educate the player on a corrective action."></annotation>
        <point text="Continued or willful disregard of these rules may require further investigation."></point>
        <annotation text="Although not all Magic Tournament Rules are penalized, even the slightest disruption repeated over and over again can still slow down an event. If this happens, an investigation may be required to see if the disruption is being done to intentionally disrupt the event or maybe a player simply needs further coaching."></annotation>
        <point text="A Warning for a Tournament Error offense is upgraded to a Game Loss if the player has already received a Warning for an offense in the same category."></point>
        <annotation text="Tournament errors are typically more disruptive and less “easy to make” than Game Play Errors. As a result, the second instance of a warning for a Tournament Error in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. All subsequent instances in the same category are also game losses. We do not keep upgrading until we get to a Disqualification. Also, there are a few Tournament Errors where the first time a player receives it, it can be a warning OR a Game loss (Tardiness and Deck Problem are examples). If the second instance of one of those penalties is supposed to be a Warning, it’s still a warning, despite receiving an earlier Game Loss."></annotation>
        <point text="For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days."></point>
        <annotation text="As with Game Play Errors, there is more of a chance that someone might repeat a Tournament Error over a 15 round Grand Prix than a 5 round PPTQ, resetting the penalty count reflects this."></annotation>

        <point text="4.1 Minor">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Warning"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player takes action that is disruptive to the tournament or its participants."></point>
            <annotation text="Actions can be “disruptive” in multiple ways. We can’t write an exhaustive list of everything disruptive because every place in the world where Magic is played has its own rules for civil life. Note that we said “disruptive”, not “offensive”, although offensive statements are almost always disruptive. The IPG makes no effort to determine if a player is “offended” as that leads to inconsistent rulings and opens up the potential for players to “game the system” by pretending to be more offended than they really are."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The IPG is applied in the same way for all problems of this type, but each judge must determine what is acceptable or not from their own experience and judgment."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Participants have the responsibility to not ruin the enjoyable atmosphere of the tournament, so as judges we must take care to educate players.  If Magic is to be a game where people have fun with each other, we must prevent behaviors that damage this. Our goal is to educate the players to be respectful in the tournament and to signal that certain behaviors are not acceptable. While “minor” may be in the title of the infraction, it is still a formal infraction and has an upgrade path. Do not confuse “minor” with how seriously we are to treat the issue. However, you also need to be cautious to not over-apply what is disruptive by taking the most extreme definition."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player failing to follow a judge’s direct instruction is also disruptive; perhaps to the tournament or to the Judges themselves. When a judge tells a player to do something, it is for the good of the event or to enforce a specific policy concern or tournament rule. We don’t tell players to change their behavior for the fun of it, or to exercise our authority because we can. Keep in mind there is a reasonable limit to what you can instruct a player to do. We don’t tell them “Go stand in the rain for 20 min”, but we will tell them “Quit shuffling in your lap.”"></annotation>
            <annotation text="Finally, if the disruptive behavior is neither Unsporting Conduct — Major nor Aggressive Behavior, then it is Unsporting Conduct — Minor."></annotation>
            <point text="It may affect the comfort level of those around the individual, but determining whether this is the case is not required."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence is included in the IPG because judges can’t have personal knowledge of all participants in the venue; it is not important to find out if there actually is a person that is actually being disturbed by the disruptive action for the penalty to apply, and we don’t have to look for such a person. However, the converse is actually true as well. Some people can be offended or upset by items below a reasonable threshold for this infraction. For example, in a sealed event, a player may be upset by the unaltered artwork on Triumph of Ferocity; this does not mean the player using the card should get a warning, or even have to change the card.  Additionally, you can always construct a fictitious person that would be discomforted by any action. Avoid using this method when determining if an action should be infracted, and instead rely on what is reasonable."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player uses excessively vulgar and profane language."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player inappropriately demands to a judge that their opponent receive a penalty."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player appeals to the Head Judge before waiting for the floor judge to issue a ruling."></example>
            <example text="- D. A player throws their deck on the ground after losing a game."></example>
            <example text="- E. A player leaves excessive trash in the play area after leaving the table."></example>
            <example text="- F. A player fails to follow the request of a tournament official to leave the play area."></example>
            <annotation text="These examples give a view of what types of behavior are unacceptable.  However, remember that the line between Unsporting Conduct – Minor and normal competitive behavior is understandably gray, as regional customs and standards of behavior vary widely. Additionally, as discussed in section 4.0, a lack of sporting behavior is not the same thing as unsporting behavior.  There are a wide range of behaviors that, while not sporting, do not fall under this infraction. For example, refusing to shake an opponent’s hand after a match does not fall under this infraction. When evaluating a situation for Unsporting Conduct – Minor, go back to the definition: did the player take an action that is disruptive?"></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="All participants should expect a safe and enjoyable environment at a tournament, and a player needs to be made aware if their behavior is unacceptable so that this environment may be maintained."></point>
            <annotation text="Unfortunately, not everyone you meet at a tournament is going to have an understanding of basic respect and courtesy. Judges, by stepping in and giving a penalty, are showing the players that certain behaviors are not acceptable. When issuing this penalty, be sure to explain the correct behavior. Education is the most important factor here. The warning is to reinforce the lesson, and to provide documentation if the infraction needs to be upgraded."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Wearing offensive clothing does not generally fall under this infraction.  Wearing clothing is a passive activity, and as such only the most extreme lapses in judgement should be considered for this infraction. Unsporting Conduct – Minor applies either for specific actions or for the failure to perform specific actions.  When an article of clothing is deemed reasonably offensive, simply ask the player to remove the shirt/cover it up/turn it inside out, and issue no penalty. Apply the infraction only if the player fails to comply with your directions."></annotation>
            <annotation text="With regard to the directed instructions, judges have a lot of authority in an event. When a judge directly instructs a player to perform an action, this infraction gives the judge the authority to enforce compliance. This doesn’t mean judges can abuse this authority; when judges give direct instructions, it must be for the benefit of the tournament."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="The player must correct the problem immediately."></point>
            <annotation text="A player who commits unsporting conduct must be educated that their behavior is not acceptable. Regardless of whether or not the player understands how the behavior is unacceptable, they are expected to stop."></annotation>
            <point text=" Subsequent Unsporting Conduct — Minor infractions, even for different offenses, will result in a Game Loss."></point>
            <annotation text="Subsequent USC-Minor infractions are penalized with a game loss.  This is to reinforce the importance of maintaining an open and welcoming environment."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that this infraction is upgraded even if the second infraction is unrelated to the previous infraction.  Keep in mind this is also relevant for direct instructions. If a judge gives a player a direct instruction to not perform an action, and the player still does, the player will get a warning for USC-Minor.  Continuing to do so after the first infraction will result in a game loss."></annotation>
            <point text="If a Game Loss is issued for repeated infractions, and it occurs at the end of a game, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the penalty to the next game instead."></point>
            <annotation text="The reason for this difference in philosophy is simple. Unlike most other infractions, it’s possible for a player to commit Unsporting Conduct – Minor after a match has already ended, but before the players have left the table. If a player has already recorded a match loss through the normal course of play, but still manages to commit this error during that same round, applying the Game Loss immediately may fail to have the intended impact on the player, and probably won’t help illustrate that their actions were unacceptable."></annotation>

        <point text="4.2 Major">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Match Loss"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
			<annotation text="As explained below, the penalty for this infraction is sometimes upgraded to Disqualification."></annotation>
            <point text="A player takes action towards one or more individuals that could reasonably be expected to create a feeling of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked."></point>
            <annotation text="In stark contrast to previous revisions of this infraction, Unsporting Conduct — Major is no longer defined by its examples. Whereas in the past, a player needed to take one of a very specific set of actions to be considered committing Unsporting Conduct — Major, this is no longer the case. This infraction has been expanded to include a wider category of unacceptable behavior."></annotation>
            <annotation text="For the purposes of identifying this infraction, it is important to consider whether or not a player’s conduct toward others might reasonably be expected to cause any of the above-listed feelings, and not necessarily that anybody has been actually made to feel any of those ways."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that it is possible for a player to commit this infraction by potentially causing these feelings in individuals other than their opponent. Participants in other matches, spectators, or tournament officials are all potential recipients of the harmful effects of a player’s misconduct. The Match Loss penalty should be applied to the offending player even if the person potentially harmed by their actions is not their current round opponent."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Finally, it should be pointed out that actual incidents of Unsporting Conduct — Major are pretty rare. Local Magic communities tend to be very self-correcting even without the presence of judges. Basic social contract theory applies here; Magic players are humans, first. Most players already refrain from acting in ways that violate the communal agreements of society at large, so instances of this infraction are likewise unusual."></annotation>
            <point text="This may include insults based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, disability, or sexual orientation."></point>
            <annotation text="A harassing comment or threatening slur directed at a person that meets the criteria above is unacceptable. Even if a comment is intended to be humorous, it may still be reasonably expected to create one or more feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked. Other players do not deserve to be spoken to in this way and judges are responsible for enforcing the standards Wizards of the Coast has put forth. It doesn’t matter if a particular judge personally feels this type of insult doesn’t merit a Match Loss, they should consider only how others might be expected to react to it."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Furthermore, the infraction doesn’t depend on whether or not anybody was actually made to feel any of these ways. The IPG has no way to measure or normalize how offended a person is. We, as judges, also do not want a player’s level of offense dictating the severity of a penalty as offense is highly subjective."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Similarly, a generic comment that merely annoys or offends another person is not necessarily sufficient for Unsporting Conduct — Major. Again, what’s important here is whether or not the action could reasonably create feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked. Here, too, judges must take care to make sure that their own personal likelihood to be offended doesn’t preclude their treating players fairly. Judges should be be mindful to neither over -nor under- penalize for Unsporting Conduct based on their own personal biases."></annotation>
            <point text="Threats of physical violence should be treated as Unsporting Conduct – Aggressive Behavior."></point>
            <annotation text="Threats of violence, be they explicit or implied, represent an even more serious category of problems that should be dealt with even more severely. Unsporting Conduct — Major does not cover these."></annotation>
            <point text="It is possible for an offender to commit this infraction without intending malice or harm to the subject of the harassment."></point>
            <annotation text="Realistically, most incidents of Unsporting Conduct — Major will have come about without malicious intent. Whether or not a player simply used a poorly-chosen word or made an instantly-regretted remark doesn’t matter in determining whether or not the infraction has been committed. If a player does or says something that could reasonably create feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked, even without meaning to, then the damage has potentially already been done and the player should still receive the penalty."></annotation>
            <annotation text="In fact, if a player committing Unsporting Conduct — Major does so with malicious intent, meaning they have acted with the specific intention of creating a toxic environment for others, then the penalty for this infraction should be upgraded to a Disqualification as explained below."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player uses a racial slur against their opponent."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player takes inappropriate photos of another player without express permission."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player asks a spectator for a date, is denied, and continues to press the issue."></example>
            <example text="- D. A player purposefully obstructs another player with the intent of inducing physical contact."></example>
            <example text="- E. A spectator uses social media to bully another player."></example>
            <annotation text="To help establish the difference between this infraction and some other similarly-seeming, yet fundamentally different errors, here are a few “anti-examples” of behavior that should usually not be considered Unsporting Conduct — Major. It may be helpful to refer back to these after reading through some other sections of this annotation."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Z. After losing a game, a player physically threatens their opponent using a racial slur and saying they’ll see them in the parking lot."></annotation>
            <annotation text="While it is true that this certainly could be expected to cause feelings of harassment and threat, this is not Unsporting Conduct — Major because it more appropriately meets the definition of Aggressive Behavior. Threatening violence is a more serious concern and so takes precedence."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Y. After losing their match, a player throws their chair in anger at a group of spectators, but doesn’t actually hit any of them."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Again, this is not Unsporting Conduct — Major. Violence directed toward someone is more properly categorized as Aggressive behavior."></annotation>
            <annotation text="X. A player refuses to shake their opponent’s hand after losing a close game. The opponent, with no reason to believe otherwise, assumes that the refusal is due to their gender."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This is not Unsporting Conduct — Major or any other infraction, really. As said in the introduction to Unsporting Conduct, unsporting behavior is not the same as a lack of sporting behavior. Refusing a friendly handshake might not be very nice, but it isn’t actually against the rules."></annotation>
            <annotation text="W. A player opens their sealed pool and exclaims to themself in disgust, “These cards are gay!”"></annotation>
            <annotation text="Once again, this is not Unsporting Conduct — Major, but does sound like it may be Unsporting Conduct — Minor. While statements like this are sure to offend some people, they are a lot less likely to cause feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked, as they are not specifically directed at anybody. Merely offending others is not sufficient for meeting the criteria for this infraction; in order for something to be considered Unsporting Conduct — Major, it must reasonably potentially cause one or more of these feelings. Note that in issuing the Unsporting Conduct — Minor infraction, the player should still be talked to about this behavior and told to knock it off."></annotation>
            <annotation text="V. A player in a losing position repeatedly shouts expletives to themself during their match and is issued a Warning for Unsporting Conduct — Minor. During the next round, that player continues to use the same expletives."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Similarly, this is not Unsporting Conduct — Major. Repeated infractions of Unsporting Conduct — Minor do not automatically upgrade the infraction to Unsporting Conduct — Major. Please refer to the Unsporting Conduct — Minor infraction in the IPG for guidance on dealing with recurrences of that error."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="A safe environment is a basic expectation of any tournament attendee. Harassment undermines the safety and integrity of a tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="This should pretty much go without saying. Magic tournaments are supposed to be safe, non-threatening, family-friendly affairs."></annotation>
            <point text="Players who purposefully create harmful or unwelcoming situations in a tournament are expected to immediately correct the behavior and demonstrate remorse or be removed."></point>
            <annotation text="Note that there is a distinction between purposefully creating a harmful and/or unwelcoming situation and doing so “with malicious intent.” A player who intentionally takes a harmful action — such as making a harassing off-color remark — might not necessarily have expected any offense by it. It’s possible, for example, for a player to use a particular ethnic slur without knowing its definition or being aware of its vulgar nature. Again, if a player did actually mean specific and longer-lasting harm with their words or actions, the penalty for the infraction should be upgraded to Disqualification as explained later."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Determining whether or not a player has demonstrated remorse requires at least a basic level of attentiveness and empathy. Statements such as “I’m sorry,” and “I shouldn’t have done that,” are good indications that a player regrets their actions and won’t repeat them. Conversely, statements like “it was just a joke,” or “this is ridiculous,” are potential red flags indicating that a player doesn’t yet understand the harmful implications of their behavior, or is simply not well-conditioned for participation in a non-threatening environment. Special care should be used by judges to ensure that infracting players disagreeing with or being upset over a Match Loss penalty are still separately given a chance to show remorse for their actions."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player not demonstrating sincere remorse should be informed that continuing to not do so will result in their Disqualification. An ultimatum like “If you want to continue playing today, you’ll need to convince me that this isn’t going to be a problem again,” may be enough to prompt the regret and humility necessary for the player to be allowed to stay in the tournament. Note that, “I don’t agree with you, but I’ll stop,” should be an acceptable response."></annotation>
            <point text="Because of the confrontational nature of this infraction, judges need to end any match in progress and separate the players."></point>
            <annotation text="Some judicious teamwork may be a useful approach, here. For example, the attending judge might ask to speak to the offending player privately. After they have been escorted from the playing area, another assisting judge might then inform the opponent that they will be receiving a win for the current match, assist them with gathering their belongings, and then ask them to leave the table. Then, after the attending judge has finished explaining the infraction and penalty to the offending player (see below for more on this topic), that judge would be able to escort them back to the playing area to retrieve their belongings without risk of further confrontation."></annotation>
            <point text="Care should be taken not to escalate the situation if at all possible. The offender will be removed from the area to receive the penalty, and education about why the behavior is unacceptable regardless of excuse."></point>
            <annotation text="Handling aggressive behavior with more aggressive behavior is a poor way to approach a situation, as it tends to make things worse. When dealing with an unruly player, keeping cool yet remaining firm is usually the best approach. Judges should remove the player from the situation by, for example, asking them to step away from the playing area or to come outside to talk. This has the effect of giving the player time to cool off, while providing an opportunity for the judge to talk with them, let them vent, and do whatever else is needed to calm the offending player down."></annotation>
            <annotation text="It is important for judges to remember to themselves remain calm. When dealing with Unsporting Conduct — Major, a judge’s first priority is to de-escalate the situation, which will be difficult or impossible if that judge is angry, upset, or visibly nervous. Assessing the penalty should only be done once everything else is under control."></annotation>
            <point text="They may need a few moments to cool down afterwards."></point>
            <annotation text="Judges should take their time dealing with all players involved in Unsporting Conduct — Major – not just the offender. Other players made to feel harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked may also require some brief counseling and/or an explanation of the corrective action being applied to the match and opponent."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Because the penalty for this infraction is a Match Loss, it is unlikely that issuing it will result in much delay to the entire tournament, even when significant time is needed to help the players cool down. Since the match is already over, an extension will usually not be required."></annotation>
            <point text="Apologizing is encouraged, but the desire of the other individuals to not interact with their harasser must be respected."></point>
            <annotation text="One of the main reasons why the penalty for Unsporting Conduct — Major is a Match Loss is that assessing it immediately disengages the offending player from their opponent. It would be unreasonable to expect the female opponent of a player who uses, for example, misogynistic language to continue the match after a judge has intervened. If such an opponent doesn’t want any further contact, this request should be honored. After the penalty is issued, the match is automatically ended, so there’s no need for any further interaction."></annotation>
            <annotation text="However, a player eager to apologize is a good indication that they are demonstrating enough remorse to be allowed to continue playing after receiving their penalty. This is true even if they are not given the chance to deliver it."></annotation>
            <point text="Officials must investigate these matters as soon as they are brought to their attention."></point>
            <annotation text="Note that because the penalty for this infraction is a Match Loss (or Disqualification), as with all penalties greater than a Warning, the Head Judge should be made aware before it is issued. However, the first priority when dealing with potential Unsporting Conduct — Major is de-escalation of the situation through separation of the players and calming of the people involved. Judges should make sure this goal is met before taking further action."></annotation>
            <point text="If they determine that the infraction does not meet the criteria for Unsporting Conduct – Major, it is still recommended that the players be talked to to avoid future misunderstandings."></point>
            <annotation text="It is expected that players will sometimes become offended or be made otherwise uncomfortable by another player’s actions without those actions being considered to reasonably cause feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked. In such a circumstance, the more appropriate infraction may be, but is not necessarily, Unsporting Conduct — Minor. Judges should refer to that infraction to make sure that the player’s behavior matches up to what’s described therein."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Fostering a safe, non-threatening, family-friendly environment by talking to players about their unfriendly conduct is highly encouraged. Judges do not need to wait until a player actually commits an infraction before getting involved. Pro-activity on the part of judges – by listening for and intervening in intensifying situations – is always a good idea. Furthermore, players should usually be talked to about their own offensive behavior even if they are not receiving a penalty."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="The player must correct the behavior immediately."></point>
            <annotation text="The outward display of remorse and a tacit agreement to not repeat the unacceptable behavior is generally all that’s necessary for correction, here. As described above, apologies should be encouraged, but they are not usually required."></annotation>
            <point text="If the offense occurs at the end of a match, it is acceptable for the judge to apply the penalty to the next match instead."></point>
            <annotation text="As a rule of thumb, if a player committing Unsporting Conduct — Major has already won (or has not yet lost) the current match, the penalty should be applied to that round, with the judge updating match results as necessary. Conversely, if the player committing the infraction has already lost the current match, the penalty should be deferred to the next round, instead."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Note that this represents a very different philosophy from that of most other infractions found in the IPG. With most other errors, it is usually appropriate to apply the penalty to the game in which the mistake has been made regardless of either player’s board position or game record. For example, if a player commits a third Game Rule Violation, that player should almost always be assessed a Game Loss for the current game even if that player happens to be very far behind on resources, is facing lethal combat damage, or is otherwise about to lose. However, this is not true for Unsporting Conduct — Major."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The reason for this difference in philosophy is simple. Unlike most other infractions, it’s possible for a player to commit Unsporting Conduct — Major after a match has already ended, but before the players have left the table. If a player has already recorded a Match Loss through the normal course of play, but still manages to commit this error during that same round, applying the Match Loss immediately may fail to have the intended impact on the player, and probably won’t help illustrate that their actions were unacceptable. Some additional dispensation – being able to delay the penalty one round – is necessary to properly deliver justice in this case. Significant errors bear significant penalties."></annotation>
            <title text="Upgrade"></title>
            <point text="If the offense was committed with malicious intent, the player displays no remorse, or the offense is repeated at a later time, the penalty is Disqualification and removal from the venue."></point>
            <annotation text="This is an admittedly tricky section of the policy, as the term “malicious intent” isn’t especially well-defined. However, what this is getting at is that judges need to use some careful discernment to investigate the intent behind Unsporting Conduct — Major infractions in order to determine the appropriate penalty. Players that simply had a temporary lapse in social decorum, were caught up in the heat of the moment, or just miscalculated the implications of their own actions probably haven’t committed this error maliciously."></annotation>
            <annotation text="On the other hand, and to quote Sean Catanese, “A player who intends to intimidate or involuntarily control someone else with their actions, yet stops short of being outright aggressive or threatening (Aggressive Behavior), is still actively choosing to harm someone. That player does not belong in a Magic tournament.” Players fitting this profile should be disqualified and removed from the venue."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A player taking inappropriate photos of another player because they think it’s funny is probably not acting with malicious intent. A player taking these photos for the purpose of using them to publicly mock the subject probably is. A player continuously asking another player for a date because they think that they can convince them to change their mind is probably not acting with malicious intent. A player continuing to ask because they know it makes them feel uncomfortable probably is. A player using a racial slur because they are frustrated and angry is probably not acting with malicious intent. A player using a racial slur that is directed and targeted as an insult probably is."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The necessity to handle these two types of cases differently stems from the fact that penalties have their natural limits. Among other things, penalties serve to educate, and a Match Loss is supposed to help teach the lesson of proper social conduct. However, it’s likely that basic education will not be enough to correct a player who has chosen to commit Unsporting Conduct — Major maliciously; there may be deeper issues with them than simple ignorance. Sometimes Disqualification is the only suitable option."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The same can be said about players that neither show remorse nor refrain from repeating the same harmful behavior. Further education will probably not be effective for these players, either, so they should be disqualified, too."></annotation>

            <point text="Match Loss"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player uses or offers to use a method that is not part of the current game (including actions not legal in the current game) to determine the outcome of a game or match, or uses language designed to trick someone who may not know it’s against the rules to make such an offer."></point>
            <annotation text="As judges, we want players actually playing Magic at our tournaments. This is not only because the point of a Magic tournament is to actually play Magic, but also to uphold Magic’s reputation and position as a game of skill, not chance. This is important for ensuring that Magic isn’t associated with gambling. In addition, game actions that could not be taken legally to come to an agreement about the outcome of the game are not permitted – see example F below."></annotation>
            <annotation text="As a result, even just offering to use an outside-the-game-method (or an illegal action within the game) falls into this infraction."></annotation>
			<annotation text="The opponent no longer is expected to call a judge, if they receive an offer."></annotation>
			<annotation text="You are also prohibited from trying to trick your opponent into making an offer to improperly determine a winner. Saying something like “Oh no. If we draw it is bad for both of us, if only there was something we could do” is prohibited."></annotation>
			<annotation text="Note: While the association with gambling factors into the reason the penalty is a Match Loss (or DQ), please keep in mind that when explaining the penalty to players, they aren’t going to care about that part of the justification. You should focus on how rolling undermines the game and the fairness to other players"></annotation>
			<point text="If the player was aware that what they were doing was against the rules, the infraction is Unsporting Conduct — Cheating."></point>
            <annotation text="We still want to treat this infraction seriously, but we do not want to DQ players who genuinely did not know this was illegal. At local stores where rules are a bit more relaxed, players might not know. We still want to educate and correct, but a DQ is too extreme. However, if players know that they are not allowed to do this, then a DQ in appropriate. Additionally, knowing that offering to roll a dice is illegal, and deliberately trying to trick your opponent into making an offer so that you can win shows a level awareness of what you are doing is wrong."></annotation>
			<title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. As time is called, two players about to draw roll a die to determine the winner."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player offers to flip a coin to determine the winner of a match."></example>
            <example text="- C. Two players arm wrestle to determine the winner of the match."></example>
            <example text="- D. Two players play rock-paper-scissors to decide if they should play the match or draw."></example>
            <example text="- E. Two players compare the converted mana costs of the top cards of their libraries to determine the winner of a game at the end of extra turns."></example>
            <example text="- F. Two players reveal cards from the top of their libraries to see “who would win” after extra turns."></example>
            <example text="- G. A player says “Oh no, we’re going to draw, that’s terrible for us. If only there were something we could do about it.”"></example>
            <annotation text="While using a random method like a die roll or coin toss is the most common example of an outside-the-game method, employing any method that isn’t the requisite game of Magic fits into this category. It doesn’t matter if the method is completely random (like a coin or die), has a physical component (arm wrestling), or is even another game entirely (like Tic-Tac-Toe or Yu-Gi-Oh). Another more controversial decision is for players to use “future cards” to determine who would win. At the end of a match, it is fine for players to use current board position to make a case of who should concede to whom; however, they must make a decision based on what they see. Players may reveal cards that they are legally entitled to see, such as their hands.  They may not reveal cards that they are not entitled to see within the game, such as cards in libraries. It is not allowed to make an offer like “If I drew another land I would win. If my next card is a land, you scoop to me, else, I’ll scoop to you.”"></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Using an outside-the-game method to determine a winner compromises the integrity of the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="As stated earlier, the results of Magic tournaments should be reached only through playing actual games of Magic. Doing otherwise compromises the integrity of the tournament. What does “compromise the integrity of the tournament” mean? It means we have games of Magic that are being determined by some method other than the Magic games the players are supposed to play, and that impacts the results of that match and the tournament as a whole. It affects other matches and other players’ standings in the event. Rolling a dice to determine the winner is playing the system, not playing the game."></annotation>
            <point text="Matches that result in a draw due to time are expected to be reported as such and are not excluded from this penalty if the players use an illegal method to determine the outcome."></point>
            <annotation text="Draws are a valid result for a Magic game. Trying to avoid a draw doesn’t give players an excuse to use an outside-the-game method to determine a winner."></annotation>
            <annotation text="That said, if a player asks their opponent to concede because they have an overwhelming board position when time is called, that is not Improperly Determining a Winner, because nothing outside the game has actually been introduced into the scenario. Of course, the opponent has every right to refuse, and in that case the match result will simply be determined normally."></annotation>

        <point text="4.4 Bribery and Wagering ">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Match Loss"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player offers an incentive to entice an opponent into conceding, drawing, or changing the results of a match, encourages such an offer, or accepts such an offer. Refer to section 5.2 of the Magic Tournament Rules for a more detailed description of what constitutes bribery."></point>
            <annotation text="Where the IPG says “refer to the Magic Tournament Rules,” it means “everything on the subject of Bribery besides the penalty is in the MTR.” So let’s summarize the key points here (please refer to the MTR for full details on the subject). Full articles have been written on what is/is not legal. We are only summarizing here."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Dropping, conceding, or agreeing to an intentional draw must not be done in exchange for any sort of reward or incentive. Statements like “I’ll scoop to you if I get your FNM promo,” or, “Hey, If I make it into the Top 8, I’ll be in the money, and I can be pretty generous” are unacceptable. “Hey, I’m hungry, let’s intentionally draw so we can go get some food before the next round” is not an offer or an incentive, and as such is acceptable."></annotation>
            <annotation text="In the Finals, there is an exception to the Bribery rules that allow players to divide prizes as they wish, so long as it does not include incentives outside of the prize pool. If the final has a prize that is not divisible, like a Pro Tour Invite, then the player who does not receive the “award” prize must drop from the tournament — not concede, but drop."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Players can use information regarding the results of another match to determine if they want to offer to intentionally draw. However, they cannot consult those other matches, or reach an agreement with them."></annotation>
            <annotation text="In some events, during the single elimination, the players may decide to split all the prizes evenly. This requires the Tournament Organizer’s agreement, and must be unanimous amongst the players."></annotation>
            <point text="Wagering occurs when a player or spectator at a tournament places or offers to place a bet on the outcome of a tournament, match or any portion of a tournament or match. The wager does not need to be monetary, nor is it relevant if a player is not betting on their own match."></point>
            <annotation text="Wagering is easier to understand. If you wager on anything in the event, you are gambling, and that is not allowed in sanctioned events. Once people wager anything on the outcome of the games within the event, if judges don’t act upon that they run the risk of damaging the image of Magic as a whole, beyond that single event. There have been cases where events like FNM were shut down by local law enforcement because they felt it was breaking gambling laws. This is the kind of thing Wizards of the Coast doesn’t want people to think of when they think of their game."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Wagering requires two or more people to be risking something. Offering a bounty on a player is not wagering. “I’ll give you a booster if you beat my friend” is only one person risking something, and even then they’re hoping they do have to give the booster away."></annotation>
            <point text="If the player was aware that what they were doing was against the rules, the infraction is Unsporting Conduct — Cheating."></point>
            <annotation text="This infraction assumes that the player or players have no knowledge that bribery or wagering are not against the rules. Knowing it is against the rules changes the infraction to Unsporting Conduct – Cheating."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player in a Swiss round offers their opponent $100 to concede the match."></example>
            <annotation text="This is an example of buying a win, and is not allowed. It’s an unfair advantage that basically would allow the person with the biggest wallet the ability to buy victories."></annotation>
            <example text="- B. A player offers their opponent a card in exchange for a draw."></example>
            <annotation text="This is an example of buying a win, and is not allowed. It’s an unfair advantage that basically would allow the person with the biggest wallet the ability to buy victories."></annotation>
            <example text="- C. A player asks for a concession in exchange for a prize split."></example>
            <annotation text="Remember that players can agree to divide prizes — perhaps because they’re friends, or they feel bad about what happened to someone else in the event — but not if the split or exchange is contingent upon any kind of match result. Saying you will concede for a prize split is illegal. However, a legal scenario is: you offer a prize split, then, once it’s accepted, you ask your opponent to concede or you concede. In this scenario, the prize split was not dependent on a concession, despite the fact that once the prize split was agreed, one player no longer wanted to play."></annotation>
            <example text="- D. Two players agree that the winner of the match will be able to choose a rare card out of the other person’s deck after the match."></example>
            <annotation text="Even something like “a soda for the draw” or “a foot rub at home later” is something that’s now affecting the decisions of the players, regardless of the intent of that offer. It could be a “joke” between two players, but we’ll never know if that’s true or not."></annotation>
            <example text="- E. Two spectators place a bet on the number of games that will be needed to decide a match."></example>
            <annotation text="This is a great example of wagering that you might not have immediately thought of."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Bribery and wagering disrupt the integrity of the tournament and are strictly forbidden."></point>
            <annotation text="By offering any incentive for the results of a match, or placing incentive on the outcome of the match, players have tainted the integrity of the event, and created an unfair play environment where results are decided by nothings other than games of Magic. Because this can be so damaging and difficult to catch, it’s penalized."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Earlier versions of the IPG had this penalty as Disqualification because of the severity of the disruption to the integrity of the tournament, that is still the case, using Unsporting Conduct – Cheating, if the player knew bribery or wagering were against the rules. It’s a lot harder to provide education to a player unaware that a small bet or what they thought was a valid prize split is against the rules when filling out disqualification paperwork than explaining why they are receiving a match loss."></annotation>

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player acts in a threatening way towards others or their property."></point>
            <annotation text="Unsporting Conduct — Aggressive Behavior is pretty clear cut. Unlike Unsporting Conduct Minor and Major, where we issue infractions based on people being made uncomfortable or hurtful/insulting language (in addition to other things), Aggressive Behavior is based on physical actions or language used to suggest an intent to cause physical harm."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player threatens to hit another player who won’t concede to them."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player pulls a chair out from under another player, causing them to fall to the ground."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player makes threats against a judge after receiving a ruling."></example>
            <example text="- D. A player tears up a card belonging to another player."></example>
            <example text="- E. A player intentionally turns over a table."></example>
            <annotation text="These examples make it pretty clear what Aggressive Behavior might be. It also includes subtle threats, such as “I’ll be waiting for you in the parking lot when you leave tonight”. You don’t need to get too hung up on specific words — you know a threat when you see one. It’s also important to note that if a player damages their own property, while possibly intimidating, it most likely doesn’t fall under Aggressive Behavior and rather falls under Unsporting Conduct – Minor — unless they are doing it in a way that constitutes a threat."></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="The safety of all people at a tournament is of paramount importance. There will be no tolerance of physical abuse or intimidation."></point>
            <annotation text="The reason we issue a Disqualification for this type of infraction is because everyone should feel safe at any sanctioned event, and allowing someone to continue in an event after such behavior would discourage players from ever wanting to participate in an event again."></annotation>
            <title text="Additional Remedy"></title>
            <point text="The offender should be asked to leave the venue by the organizers jugadores de volver a participar en un evento."></point>
            <annotation text="Keep in mind that your first priority is to defuse the situation. How to do this depends on the situation. However, you are not a police officer, and are not obligated to get involved physically. When this infraction occurs, that player’s day at the event is over. They will be disqualified. Be sure to collect a statement for the Investigations Committee if the player is willing to give one, and be sure to write your own. It’s also advised that the Tournament Organizer ask the player to leave the venue as soon as possible. An important distinction here is that the Tournament Organizer should be the one to actually make this decision. We can encourage the Tournament Organizer to make this decision, but our jurisdiction does not reach beyond the scope of the event. Once the player is no longer involved with the event, they’re no longer someone we, as judges, should be dealing with."></annotation>

        <point text="4.6 Theft of Tournament Material">
            <title text="Penalty"></title>
            <point text="Disqualification"></point>
            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player steals materials from the tournament, including but not limited to cards or tournament equipmen."></point>
            <annotation text="Stealing is unacceptable behavior. This type of conduct is just as intolerable at Magic tournaments as it is among society at large. There is a clear line here; in order to receive this penalty, the theft must be of materials from the tournament. Theft of an EDH deck of a player enrolled in a Standard event is not Theft of Tournament Material. It is still unacceptable though, and the TO should still be notified. Stealing is wrong."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player steals cards from the sideboard of their opponent."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player steals the table number from a table.."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player realizes they have a previous opponent’s card, but they hide it instead of telling a tournament official."></example>
            <annotation text="Example C makes it clear that players who did not intentionally set out to steal something may still end up committing this infraction through later inaction. A phenomenon that’s as old as Magic is players forgetting to give their opponents back a creature they took with Control Magic, and instead accidentally scooping and shuffling it in. Doing this is not a problem in and of itself, provided that the player gives the card back or otherwise calls a judge as soon as they notice the issue. However, a player noticing that they still accidentally have their last round opponent’s Thragtusk in their deck and choosing to stay quiet about it is a big problem, and still meets the definition of this infraction. Think of it as a form of “passive theft.”"></annotation>
            <title text="Philosophy"></title>
            <point text="Players enter a tournament expecting that their materials will be protected."></point>
            <annotation text="As the saying goes, your rights end where others’ begin. Players have a right to their own stuff, and thus you have no right to take it. We shouldn’t actually need the IPG to tell us this much."></annotation>
            <point text="This does not absolve the players from their responsibility to keep an eye on their possessions, but they should expect to be able to retain the product they began with or were given for the tournament."></point>
            <annotation text="Thievery is an ever-present concern, and keeping an eye on one’s own stuff is important. Despite constant reminders from judges, Tournament Organizers, and here even the IPG itself, it’s rare to get through a large tournament without at least a few players’ weekends getting ruined by stolen bags. While judges should remain vigilant for thieves, players are ultimately responsible for their own possessions."></annotation>
            <point text="Other instances of theft not involving tournament materials are the responsibility of the Tournament Organizer, though judges are encouraged to help in any way possible."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence is a little tricky. What happens if a player steals a bag of trade binders, but not a player’s deck? Technically, this is not actually Theft of Tournament Material, although the outcome (the removal of the player from your tournament) has more-or-less the same consequences. If theft is brought to a judge’s attention, the judge should involve the Tournament Organizer. They will deal with removing the individual from the store, or handling police involvement. In such a case, this information still really ought to be reported to the Investigations Committee through that handy “Investigations” tab in the Judge Center. For all intents and purposes, a player stealing a bag should be handled in the same way as one who has committed this infraction."></annotation>

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A player intentionally plays slowly in order to take advantage of the time limit."></point>
            <annotation text="This infraction describes situations in which a player is fully aware of the time remaining in the round and they attempt to run the clock out in order to win or deny the opponent the time needed to play. For example, a player may count or look through their sideboard or graveyard for no strategic reason. Alternatively, the player may act as if they are looking for tokens, emblems, or dice, and take an unusual amount of time in doing so."></annotation>
            <point text="If the slow play is not intentional, please refer to Tournament Error — Slow Play instead."></point>
            <annotation text="Not all players who take a long time to play the game are necessarily doing so intentionally. Magic is a complex game with many factors to be considered. Large cash prizes, invites, Grand Prix byes, etc., may provide players with incentive to take their time when thinking about their actions. If it is determined that the player did not have intent to run out the clock, then the infraction is not Stalling."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The key thing to look for when issuing a penalty for Stalling is intent. If there wasn’t intent on the part of the player, then the appropriate infraction is Slow Play."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A player has two lands in their hand, no options available to significantly affect the game, and spends excessive time “thinking” about what to do to eat up time on the clock."></example>
            <annotation text="A player encounters a situation where they realize that there’s no significant play available, but knows the opponent has no way of verifying this. The player intentionally acts as though they have difficult options to consider in an effort to use up time. Here there is a difference between “bluffing” and Stalling. In the case of bluffing, the motivation is not to eat up clock time. However, excessive time ‘thinking’ in order to bluff is Slow Play."></annotation>
            <example text="- B. A player is ahead in games and significantly slows down their pace of play so the opponent has little chance to catch up."></example>
            <annotation text="A player wins the first game and realizes that instead of winning a second game, they could waste the time that the opponent would need to catch up by intentionally playing slowly."></annotation>
            <example text="- C. A player playing slowly appeals a warning in an attempt to gain advantage by having more time to make a decision."></example>
            <annotation text="A player tries to take advantage of a tournament’s appeals process in order to steal some extra time to think. For example, with only two minutes left in a match and facing a tough decision, a player appeals a minor ruling knowing that doing so will provide at least five minutes of thinking before the Head Judge can respond to the call. The player knows that his match will afterward receive at least a five-minute extension, so he thinks he can abuse the appeals process as a means of buying time.Protip – judges can help prevent players from committing this infraction with a little pre-emptive care! Often, a wily player out to commit the above-described infraction will do so by appealing the Warning he’s receiving for committing the infraction Slow Play itself. So, if you give a Slow Play warning to a player that they then appeal, you should instruct the players to continue playing while you get the Head Judge. By telling the players to continue to play, you’ll prevent any possibility of a player getting away with this kind of clock manipulation. And ask another judge to watch to make sure they follow the instructions."></annotation>
            <example text="- D. A player intentionally mulligans slowly before the third game in an attempt to make it harder for their opponent to win in time."></example>
            <annotation text="After splitting the match 1-1, a player who is playing for a draw against an opponent who needs the win may decide to take their time sideboarding, shuffling, and mulliganing to eat up time in an effort to force the match to a draw."></annotation>
            <example text="- E. A player losing a game starts slowing down the pace of play in an attempt to run out the clock"></example>
            <annotation text="A player knows that they are about to lose the current game, but realizes it is possible to draw the match if the opponent is unable to “finish them off” in time.

            <title text="Definition"></title>
            <point text="A person breaks a rule defined by the tournament documents, lies to a tournament official, or notices an offense committed in their (or a teammate's) match and does not call attention to it."></point>
            <annotation text="This sentence is an exhaustive list of the situations that can be considered Cheating. If the basic situation does not match one of these three categories, it is not Cheating. Moreover, all intentional violations of the tournament rules fall under the provision of Cheating (except for Slow Play, which is Stalling), and should not be treated simply as upgraded versions of other infractions."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The phrases “breaking a rule” and “notices an offense” include violations of the Comprehensive Rules and of the Magic Tournament Rules. Players are required to call a judge when they make an error. Additionally, because both players are responsible for the game state, players are also expected to call a judge when they notice their opponent commit an offense."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The IPG stipulates that, in team formats, players are also responsible for pointing out offenses in their teammates’ matches. This is because each team advances in the tournament and earns prizes as a group. Accordingly, members of a team are accountable for calling attention to mistakes they notice in their teammates’ matches as well as their own."></annotation>
            <point text="Additionally, the offense must meet the following criteria for it to be considered Cheating:"></point>
            <point text="- The player must be attempting to gain advantage from their action."></point>
            <point text="- The player must be aware that they are doing something illegal."></point>
            <annotation text="In Magic, cheating is always a deliberate action, or conscious lack of action. There is no such thing as “accidental cheating”. Accidental errors should be handled by the appropriate infractions found elsewhere in the IPG."></annotation>
            <annotation text="Additionally, if a player is not attempting to gain advantage from their action, then the offense is not Cheating.."></annotation>
            <annotation text="This bullet is sort of weird, generally you think of someone trying to gain an advantage when they cheat, which is exactly the point. If there is no advantage, there is no cheating. For example: Alex, who is at 6 life, attacks with a creature the turn it was summoned. Nat notices, but just takes the damage because they are holding 2 Lightning Bolts in their hand, and want to let Alex get in a hit so Alex doesn’t feel as crushed when Nat wins next turn. In this case, Nat is not committing an infraction. Be aware though, that because this rule is published where players can see it, some may be tempted to craft stories where it seems like they were just trying to be ‘nice’. It is your responsibility to determine as much of the truth as possible."></annotation>
            <annotation text="A third thing that is not on this list, but is stated in the definition, the player actually has to be breaking a rule. If a player misunderstands a rule, thinks they are doing something illegal for an advantage, but what they are doing is actually legal; that’s not Cheating."></annotation>
            <annotation text="The IPG used to define Cheating as a separate category of infractions, including Cheating — Fraud, Cheating — Hidden Information Violation, and Cheating — Manipulation of Game Materials. In January 2013, the IPG was updated to rule these various infractions into a single, streamlined infraction called Unsporting Conduct – Cheating. This makes it easier for judges to determine whether a certain action is Cheating, as the criteria for Cheating are now the same for all types of offenses."></annotation>
            <point text="If all criteria are not met, the offense is not Cheating and is handled by a different infraction."></point>
            <annotation text="The IPG clearly specifies the criteria that must be met for an offense to be Cheating so that judges can more easily identify situations where Cheating has actually occurred. If one or more of the criteria for Cheating is not met, the judge should consider whether a different infraction applies, if any. Do not apply your own definition."></annotation>
            <point text="Cheating will often appear on the surface as a Game Play Error or Tournament Error, and must be investigated by the judge to make a determination of intent and awareness."></point>
            <annotation text="The ability to conduct investigations is highly prized by the judge community; it is one of the qualities of Regional Judges, and one that all judges should strive to cultivate. The IPG does not require definite proof of the intent to cheat, but rather expects officials to exercise their best judgment to determine if a player is deliberately breaking a rule to gain an advantage. This sentence is a reminder to remain vigilant and ask questions. This particular skill is a hard one to develop as each potential situation is unique."></annotation>
            <title text="Examples"></title>
            <example text="- A. A player alters the results on a match slip without their opponent’s knowledge."></example>
            <example text="- B. A player lies to a tournament official about what happened in a game to make their case stronger."></example>
            <example text="- C. A player allows their opponent to put a creature into the graveyard even though the creature has not been dealt lethal damage."></example>
            <example text="- D. A player notices that their opponent resolved only half of the triggered ability of Sword of Feast and Famine and decides not to call attention to the error."></example>
            <example text="- E. A player peeks at another player’s picks during the draft."></example>
            <example text="- F. A player adds cards to their Sealed Deck pool."></example>
            <example text="- G.A player realizes they have accidentally drawn an extra card, then fails to call a judge in order to avoid a penalty."></example>
            <annotation text="All of these are examples of a player intentionally violating game rules, tournament rules, or lying. While this is not an exhaustive list, it covers many of the most common cases. One thing that is noticeably absent: not pointing out your opponents Missed Trigger. This is never cheating, even if you point out the Missed Trigger at a point in time that is beneficial to you."></annotation>

        <point text="Unsporting conduct is disruptive behavior that may affect the safety, competitiveness, enjoyment, or integrity of a tournament in a significantly negative fashion."></point>
        <annotation text="This is a general definition of what constitutes “Unsporting Conduct”, and it’s pretty broad. Some of you might think it covers a lot more stuff than you would have expected — but bear in mind that all these things are vital in to the provision of a good tournament experience. As judges we need to be watchful for things that can create negative experiences for players, and deal with them as appropriate."></annotation>
        <point text="Unsporting behavior is not the same as a lack of sporting behavior. There is a wide middle ground of “competitive” behavior that is certainly neither “nice” nor “sporting” but still doesn’t qualify as “unsporting”."></point>
        <annotation text="It’s important to make this clarification. If a player is not being nice to you, that doesn’t necessarily mean they are being unsporting. For example, you are not required to say “Good game” after getting crushed, you don’t have to shake hands, your opponent doesn’t have to tell you exactly what a card does, etc. None of these things constitute Unsporting Conduct. A player is allowed to have their “game face” on."></annotation>
        <point text="The Head Judge is the final arbiter on what constitutes unsporting conduct."></point>
        <annotation text="A Floor Judge can decide to issue an Unsporting Conduct penalty, but players may appeal this ruling. Just as with many other sections of this document, the Head Judge is the final authority when it comes to determining whether something is Unsporting Conduct. It is also necessary to get the Head Judge’s agreement/approval prior to giving any infraction with a penalty of Game Loss or higher, and if it’s a Disqualification, the Head Judge should be the one giving it."></annotation>
        <point text="Judges should inform the player how their conduct is disruptive. The player is expected to correct the situation and behavior immediately. However, while making sure that the player understands the severity of their actions is important, judges should focus first on calming a situation, and deal with infractions and penalties afterwards."></point>
        <annotation text="Sometimes players do not notice that their behavior is being disruptive to the event. They are wrapped up in their own concerns, so the judges have to let them know that what they are doing is causing a problem. After being told, the player should immediately correct their actions. However, in order to prevent situations from escalating, the primary focus of judges should be to get the situation under control. Basically, if you have a player who is angry, giving them a penalty at that moment will probably make things worse. Get control of the situation, and then worry about infractions."></annotation>
